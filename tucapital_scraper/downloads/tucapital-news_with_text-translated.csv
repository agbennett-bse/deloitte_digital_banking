The French entity has already extended 5 times without changes since January 2024, when it made the first cut in recent years and affected exclusively the 2-year deposit, which fell from 3.85% APR to 3.44% APR.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
As for your savings account, it leads to 2.89% APR from November 2023 without changes:

The characteristics of your 2-year deposit currently are:
Offer valid until April 24, 2024.
And the Account With You:
Offer valid until April 24, 2024.


Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right.
Renault Bank once again extends the profitability of its savings products without changes, this time, for three weeks, until April 10, 2024.
We thought that there was more probability of a decline than anything else, so this extension without cuts is good news."
1,ING gives you up to €120 if you direct your payroll and pay with their card,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-te-da-hasta-120e-si-domicilias-nomina-y-pagas-con-su-tarjeta/,22/04/2024,"ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before I gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120:
It gives you 6 months to do it, and the bank returns 15% of what you spend in those supermarkets paying with the ING card. That is, you have to spend €800 to get €120.
We don't think it's a big problem, it would mean spending around €130 a month in those supermarkets; but it's one more turn of the screw. This bank year after year wants to squeeze a little more out of savers.
The offer will be valid until May 26, 2024.
As disadvantages, it does not have immediate transfers.


ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
ING once again cuts the profitability of its Orange deposits. Now it offers a maximum of 2.40% APR instead of the 2.55% APR that it had been offering.
It is the fourth consecutive drop in these products that were launched in the month of December, giving a maximum of 3% APR. With the successive decreases: in January, February, at the beginning of March and now, it remains at 2.4% APR."
2,Banco BIG deposits: slight increase in normal and combined deposits 5.06% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/depositos-de-banco-big-ligera-subida-los-normales-y-combinados-506-tae/,22/04/2024,"Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
For example, before the welcome deposit was 4.1% APR, it is now 4.1% TIN and therefore the APR becomes 4.14% for a 6-month term and interest payment due.
The welcome deposit, which suffered a drop last month from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR, is now 4.14% APR.
The previous changes made by the bank were:
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
The bank has not yet established a marketing period for this product.
Banco BIG offers in its Big BIG Account at 1.51% APR:
The Banco Big paid account is commission-free and has a Spanish IBAN, but under the Portuguese FGD. It is ING-style, but its headquarters are in Portugal.
As we always tell you, these products are not interesting. The extra return offered by the deposit could be insignificant compared to the possible positive or negative returns of the fund, in addition to the fund manager's fees.
The deposit is just a hook offer to attract inexperienced people and so that you don't wonder about the important part of the offer, the fund.
The bank has 2 offers that depend on the percentage of money you allocate to the fund:
Both offers start from a minimum investment of €10,000 and require you to keep the fund at least until the deposit matures. In case of default, you would not be paid interest on the deposit.


This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers.
Yes, the usual shit... deposit rates drop and banks begin to take advantage of people's misinformation to sneak in products they don't want attached to supposedly high-profit deposits.
This is how Banco BIG has been for a few days with its deposit at 5% APR and now MyInvestor with its deposit at 4% APR."
3,The future of Bitcoin: predictions for the next 5 years,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/el-futuro-de-bitcoin-predicciones-para-los-proximos-5-anos/,22/04/2024,"Since its launch, Bitcoin has seen positive and negative changes. However, most of the improvements related to Bitcoin resonate with the interest of investors around the world. Bitcoin currently has a significant lead in the cryptocurrency sector, the main reason behind its popularity. With the year 2023 here, experts predict that Bitcoin will continue to impact the financial industry in several ways. Understanding Bitcoin trends is vital to ensuring usage and successful businesses.
With the growing demand for cryptocurrencies around the world, a simultaneous growth in the number of analytical tools is notable. In this case, platforms like Trader AI are indispensable as they allow Bitcoin traders and investors to make informed decisions. Furthermore, such tools provide people with a clear projection of future expectations. Here are some Bitcoin predictions for the next five years:
In particular, Bitcoin has shown significant value growth since its launch. It is the only cryptocurrency that grew exponentially by more than 3,000% in a significantly short period after its launch. However, Bitcoin experienced a drop in value following the global economic recession from 2019 to date. Projections, however, indicate that with the expected stabilization of the global economy, the value of Bitcoin will increase significantly. There is a chance that Bitcoin will reach the $10 million mark in the next five years.
Being the first cryptocurrency to launch, Bitcoin quickly penetrated the market, with greater demand than other altcoins that emerged later. In a short time, Bitcoin exhibited its dominance in the crypto markets, which is why many investors and traders expressed interest in it. Despite the global economic downturn, Bitcoin still maintains a significant lead in crypto markets. Current indicators communicate Bitcoin's dominance over the next five years.
Bitcoin developers pioneered and implemented the idea of ​​developing a decentralized currency. Bitcoin inspired other currency developers to create a decentralized mechanism for initiating and completing transactions. Many people and companies consider Bitcoin to be an important player in the migration from a centralized to a decentralized monetary mechanism. Many believe that fully decentralized exchanges will materialize with the continued adoption of Bitcoin over the next five years.
Bitcoin is also considered an important element in facilitating business evolution worldwide. Demand for Bitcoin has increased significantly, leading businesses to adopt it as a means of payment. More companies are rapidly updating current payment mechanisms to incorporate Bitcoin. Experts predict that Bitcoin will greatly influence businesses by allowing them to support cryptocurrency payments. In this case, global companies will likely dominate the economy due to the introduction and use of Bitcoin as a means of payment.
A major concern since the launch of Bitcoin was taxation regulated by government bodies. Notably, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that requires no regulators or intermediaries. That means that the government and the respective bodies do not have the mandate to embark on the regulation or control of crypto markets. As a result, experts project that Bitcoin will greatly and negatively affect taxes globally.
While Bitcoin developments over the next five years may be unpredictable, there are some signs that the cryptocurrency will be among the market leaders. Bitcoin's current strength indicates that the currency's performance and future are bright. In particular, new altcoins are entering the crypto markets, which could change the course of Bitcoin in terms of development. However, Bitcoin is likely to continue dominating the cryptocurrency market over the next five years.

Perhaps you are wondering what qualities make Bitcoin considered money? Here's a guide to what makes this digital money so valuable.
Maybe you're wondering why the Bitcoin market is about to explode? Here's why the Bitcoin market will likely adopt this trend."
4,"Eco: Cetelem only allows maximum daily transfers of €30,000",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/eco/eco-cetelem-solo-permite-transferencias-maximas-diarias-de-30-000e/,19/04/2024,"Due to the disappearance of Orange Bank, and the transfer of clients to Cetelem, the first ""unknown"" problems of this entity appear.
Today we echo a complaint from one of our users and new Cetelem client who complains about the maximum limit that the entity allows in daily transfers.
This limit, of €30,000, is considered insufficient, and that the entity should modify or remove.
Good morning.
I appreciate your banking information service.
I was a customer of Orange Bank and due to the Cetelem promotion I have migrated my funds to said bank, the truth is that I have not had any problems with the registration.
Now, I think it is worth echoing that once you have made the transfer to Cetelem, which in my case was 100K, I was disappointed to find out after complaining and receiving an official response from the bank, that it is not possible to make transfers of a high amount. On the same day, it is only possible to make 3 daily transfers of 10k and so that the account is not blocked, enter different concepts, that is, €30,000 per day.
What does a client do who needs his money to make an operation or investment on that day above 30k?
I think we should publish this outrage so that the bank modifies these policies that they claim are for our safety, but that become a mini corralito.
All the best.
We have confirmed this information with the entity: SEPA transfers have a maximum execution period of one business day, if they are ordered after 5:00 p.m., they will be processed the next business day. They have a maximum limit per operation of 10,000 euros and a maximum daily limit of 30,000 euros.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem.
Cetelem offers a ""welcome plan"" to Orange Bank customers by giving them a checking account that will be remunerated at 3.25% APR with no balance limit and a debit card with no fees."
5,"B100, another decent alternative to Orange Bank: commission-free account at 2.7% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/b100-otra-alternativa-decente-a-orange-bank/,18/04/2024,"We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
As we have said, immediate transfers have a cost, in this case, of €1.5 for each one compared to the ""0"" cost of Orange Bank.
This is a minor problem, when you have Bizum, you could use it to transfer money immediately and for free even between your own accounts (see here).
On the other hand, you have to withdraw cash at their own ATMs (Abanca's) whenever you want, and they allow you to withdraw twice a month at no cost at the following ATM networks:
Yes, there are many ATMs, but Orange Bank allowed you to withdraw from any ATM and 3 times a month at no cost.
B100 offers slightly more profitability, 2.7% APR compared to 2% APR. If you also take care of yourself, it gives you a 3.4% APR on the Heath account. For that, you have to meet some physical well-being goals, and it doesn't let you put all the money you want in said account.
B100, since it is a Spanish entity, the money is covered by the Spanish FGD, compared to the French Orange Bank.
It is a current account for your daily life with no maintenance or administration fees, just like the Orange Bank current account.
It also does not charge you for transfers in the euro zone, transfers, Bizum, card...
It is an account without remuneration, without requiring anything in return; It also gives you a card with no fees for issuance, renewal, or currency exchange abroad when you use it.
It is a paid account:
The Health account is the same as the Save account, but it gives you a little more profitability if you meet health goals.
To deposit money into this account you will have to choose a daily step goal from several options and select an amount to transfer from your B100 Account, between €1 and €30 per day.
The transfer is automatic if you meet the objectives.


We still do not know how Orange Bank will end up with Cetelem, but B100, an Abanca online entity, wants to be its replacement and offers a very similar product in certain aspects and in others, improved.
It will offer an account, the B100 account, without commissions, with a card and all the services and remunerated, the same as Orange Bank.
If you want to save, it gives you a paid account at 2.7% APR in the Save account, better than Orange Bank (2% APR), and is a short distance from the Renault Bank Account (2.89% APR)."
6,Banca March raises its Avantio Flexible Deposit to 3.1% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banca-march-sube-su-deposito-flexible-avantio-hasta-el-31-tae/,17/04/2024,"Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
The bank does not require large capital to hire, from €10,000; and allows early cancellations.
In this case, the bank continues to compensate you for your money, at 1.51% APR instead of 3.1%, which by the way, in the previous offer, in case of cancellation, the profitability was 1% APR.
This product is exclusively for new customers who open the Avantio account through digital channels.
The characteristics of this fixed term are:
The offer will be valid until May 31, 2024.
This product has a dark side, the Avantio Account. It is free only if you have €10,000 invested in a bank product; in addition to other conditions that are easy to meet.
The entity accepts the €10,000 deposit so that you do not pay commissions on the account. So the problem would come after the expiration. You will have to cancel the account or you will have to pay €75 in semi-annual commissions (€150 per year).
The account is remunerated at 1% APR, but if you additionally direct a payroll, the account will give you 2.53% APR (2.5% TIN) for a maximum of €50,000.
The account supports up to 2 account holders.


Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.
The bank set the marketing deadline for this product until April 12, 2023.
Banca March relaunches the Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and now at 3% APR for new digital clients.
It represents a reduction of 0.3 percentage points compared to what the bank offered until December 31, 2023.
Banca March will continue to offer 12-month deposit terms and 3.3% APR until December 31, 2023.
This deposit, which was scheduled to end its marketing period on October 31, 2023, will be available to savers during the rest of the year."
7,Is Cetelem's 3.25% APR worth it? Is it better than Orange Bank?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/merece-la-pena-el-325-tae-de-cetelem-es-mejor-que-orange-bank/,16/04/2024,"We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
As we saw with N26, its shortcomings were:
But it also has some extra advantages over Orange Bank:
The big drawback of Cetelem is that it charges commissions (€1.99 per month from 2025), in addition to lacking the Bizum service (see the comparison here).
Instead, it offers other advantages, such as 3.25% APR of account profitability instead of 2% APR, and deposits of up to 4% APR or that the money is under the Spanish FGD.
So what does that €1.99 per month commission mean? We must compare the remuneration against the cost.
Conclusions:
In addition, until 2025 you are exempt from commissions on the account, we believe that Cetelem's offer is good.


Due to the disappearance of Orange Bank, and the transfer of clients to Cetelem, the first ""unknown"" problems of this entity appear.
Today we echo a complaint from one of our users and new Cetelem client who complains about the maximum limit that the entity allows in daily transfers.

The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem.
It will not be an automatic process. If you want the Cetelem offer you must perform one action or another depending on whether or not you are already a Cetelem customer:
You must follow 3 steps:

Get in touch via the telephone number that you can consult in your Cetelem App - “Contact us” section - so that your conditions can be updated to the exclusive offer for Orange Bank customers.
You must cancel the account before June 17, 2024.
You must change your receipts, payroll, and subscriptions to a new account in which you are the owner.
If you have a debit card, you must destroy it.
Once you cancel the account, you will no longer have access to the Orange Bank app, so while you can still access it, download all the documentation that you consider important.
Be careful with purchase returns already made with the Orange Bank card. You must tell the merchant that that card no longer exists, and they must return the money to you in another way.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120

Now we give you the bad news: analyzing this offer in more depth, it is simply the Cetelem Premium Plan with slight improvements:
* Premium Plan has an initial cost of €1.99 until June 30, 2024.
* Welcome Plan is free of charge until December 31, 2024.
If you are an Orange Bank customer, you must unsubscribe before June 17, 2024, and if you want, you can also contract this Cetelem Welcome Plan.

In this sense, Orange Bank communicates on its website and will put an end to an entity that has offered a great service to its clients for just under 7 years.
The closure will be worse than we thought. It will be a closing and a new account opening. There will not be a migration.
The Orange Bank website tells you that you must close the account (Checking Account, Savings Account and Debit Card) before June 17, 2024.
It reminds you that you must change your receipts, payroll, and subscriptions, download all the documentation that you consider necessary, and if you have a physical card, you must destroy the plastic of your Debit Card.
Come on, this is the definitive purpose of Orange Bank for clients, and as an alternative, it offers you if you want to go to Cetelem, and with Cetelem's conditions.
Like, ""special"" promotion offers you a ""welcome plan"", which is nothing more than the Cetelem Premium Plan with slight improvements. See comparison here.
We have never seen anything like it.
As Orange Bank indicates, we must move all the money from the bank to other entities, from both accounts: checking account and savings account.
Move the receipts that you have direct debit at the bank, and thus you will avoid inconveniences of returned receipts.
The account closing process is quite simple. You just have to start a conversation via chat in the Orange Bank APP and an operator will help you in the process.

The promotion was valid until April 30, and stopped working ten days ago.
The bank did not contact the client to indicate that said promotion was cancelled. That's called false advertising.
I hope you can disclose how the entity works, lying to its clients.
Thank you for your portal, your seriousness and effectiveness. Kind regards
Banco Sabadell gave €50 to its existing clients for each new client they brought to the bank, up to a maximum of 5, that is, a bonus of €250.
New customers also received a welcome €50.
This promotion, according to its announcement, would be valid from March 1, 2024 to April 30, 2024 (both inclusive). However, there is no longer any trace of this offer on the Sabadell website and our user is complaining because it has stopped working for more than 1 week.
According to Sabadell's offer document, the entity reserves ""the right to cancel the promotion for justified cause"", however, if such an event occurs, it must be ""duly informed and will take effect from the date it is issued."" the communication"".
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000.
Banco de Sabadell has once again extended the contracting of its Online Account without commissions and remunerated at 6% TIN during the first 3 months if you are a new customer of the bank.
This time, the new deadline given by the bank is until February 29, 2 more weeks and it is the third extension of deadlines by the bank. The first time, on January 2, for almost 1 month, then on January 30, for 15 more days and now for another 15."
12,Navigating Finances in the World of Online Entertainment: A Look at Rabona Casino,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/navegando-las-finanzas-en-el-mundo-del-entretenimiento-online-un-vistazo-a-rabona-casino/,15/04/2024,"Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino, whose website is https://rabonacasino.es, can be an experience full of excitement and fun. However, beyond the entertainment, there are valuable lessons about managing personal finances. Each decision made in roulette or blackjack, for example, contains strategies applicable not only in the game, but also in our daily finances.
A primary lesson that the environment of chance teaches us is the importance of managing risk. When placing bets, players must carefully evaluate their chances of success, weighing risks against potential rewards. This evaluation is very similar to everyday financial decisions, such as choosing between investing in an asset or saving. The essential thing is not to risk more than you are willing to lose, applicable to both entertainment platforms and investments.
Each game at Rabona casino has its own level of risk. For example, slot machines are typically high risk but also offer the potential for big wins, while options like blackjack or poker require more strategy and offer better long-term odds. Choosing which games to participate in is similar to deciding which investments or financial projects to embark on, considering our risk appetite and financial goals.
Participating in games on platforms like Rabona casino requires establishing a budget and staying true to it, a recommended financial discipline practice. Allocating a specific amount for this activity is similar to determining how much to spend, save, and invest in our financial lives.

13,N26 could be a great alternative to Orange Bank,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/n26-si-que-podria-ser-una-gran-alternativa-a-orange-bank/,12/04/2024,"A couple of days ago we tried to find a good alternative to Orange Bank, and it was an almost impossible task (see here). No offer equals that of Orange Bank, much less improves it.
All the products we compared had shortcomings and we missed 1, 2 or even more advantages of Orange Bank:
And there were many offers that we analyzed: Orange Cetelem, Myinvestor, Pibank, Ing, Openbank, Bankinter, Banco Santander, BBBVA, Banco Sabadell and Money Go.
But once the article was published, one of our users made us aware of the N26 offer, and yes, we believe it is one of the most similar to Orange Bank.
It is without commissions, without conditions. Everything is free: card, transfers, Bizum, cash withdrawals at any ATM. Basically almost everything that Orange Bank offers.
However, something is still missing:
But it also has some extra advantages over Orange Bank:
All in all, if things change at Orange Bank, N26 is a great alternative to consider.


ING is the online bank that has captured the most deposits during the first half of 2023 (3,348 million), according to data from the Bank of Spain.
In fact, it is the online bank with the most money on deposit from savers and with a very large margin. Do you understand now why ING does not increase its deposits more?
Where are those bankers who in times of negative rates came out vehemently saying that if the ECB charges them for putting money in the central bank, they should pass those costs on to clients.
Well, now the ECB pays banks to deposit their money there at 4%. Which banks offer that right now! What are the bankers saying now?
N26 launched a savings account at 2.26% APR in mid-May, being one of the most profitable on the market and it does so without asking for anything: without a new client, without payroll or income, and it offers it for an indefinite period of time.
As a drawback, even though there are no client restrictions, the account does not appear to everyone in the APP. The bank has established a progressive scheme for contracting this account, which has caused outrage among clients who still do not have this product available."
14,"ING relaunches its deposit capture: less profitable, 2.5% APR; and less term, 3 months",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ing-relanza-su-deposito-dinero-nuevo-pero-menos-rentable-y-por-menos-plazo/,11/04/2024,"ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
In this way, it is communicating to its clients via email with the new offer, which is less profitable (2.5% compared to 2.75% APR in February) and for less time (3 months compared to 4 months).
If we compare it with offers from other entities, this profitability is quite poor:
Furthermore, these entities do not demand new money. Simply, if you want it, you hire it, without conditions.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
In any case, it is always good news that you try to raise money.
The characteristics of its deposits are:
The offer will be valid until April 30, 2024.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
ING once again cuts the profitability of its Orange deposits. Now it offers a maximum of 2.40% APR instead of the 2.55% APR that it had been offering.
It is the fourth consecutive drop in these products that were launched in the month of December, giving a maximum of 3% APR. With the successive decreases: in January, February, at the beginning of March and now, it remains at 2.4% APR."
15,"Good news, Renault Bank only extends your Account at 2.89% APR and Deposit at 3.44% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/buena-noticia-renault-bank-solo-prorroga-su-cuenta-al-289-tae-y-deposito-al-344-tae/,11/04/2024,"Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
The new contracting period for these products will be until April 24, 2024, that is, 2 more weeks.
Therefore, we have had 5 extensions since the bank decided in January to make the first cut since September 2021.
This rate drop only affected your 2-year deposit, which fell from 3.85% APR to 3.44% APR.
On the other hand, his savings account has yet to take a cut. Its current rate was set at 2.89% APR in November 2023.

The characteristics of your 2-year deposit currently are:
Offer valid until April 24, 2024.
And the Account With You:
Offer valid until April 24, 2024.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right.
Renault Bank once again extends the profitability of its savings products without changes, this time, for three weeks, until April 10, 2024.
We thought that there was more probability of a decline than anything else, so this extension without cuts is good news."
16,"Alternatives to Orange Bank, nothing will be as good",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/alternativas-a-orange-bank-nada-sera-tan-bueno/,10/04/2024,"Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
We still do not know the conditions that Cetelem will apply to the more than 200,000 Orange Bank customers, but to begin with, Cetelem's offer is much worse. You can see it in the comparison that we left you yesterday (see here).
Orange Bank is not the bank that gives the most profitability in its account, nor does it offer large deposits (in fact, it does not offer any), but it is the set of things it has that makes it the best operating account:
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Coincidentally, one of the most similar offers is Money Go, with Cetelem support, but as we said, things fail:
Another good offer is Openbank, specifically its current account that requires nothing and gives everything for free, but we miss:
Pibank has some things even better than Orange Bank, such as better profitability, deposits, unlimited cash withdrawals, but it has several problems:
ING is similar, although it does not require payroll or pension in the No Account Account, but you have limited services:
And if you domiciliate a payroll or pension, something improves, but it is still worse:
MyInvestor is another option, with its buts:
The Bankinter SIN Account also fails in:
And so it is a sum and continues:
Are we forgetting an offer? Let us know in the comments.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000.
Banco de Sabadell has once again extended the contracting of its Online Account without commissions and remunerated at 6% TIN during the first 3 months if you are a new customer of the bank.
This time, the new deadline given by the bank is until February 29, 2 more weeks and it is the third extension of deadlines by the bank. The first time, on January 2, for almost 1 month, then on January 30, for 15 more days and now for another 15."
17,Orange Bank no longer allows you to sign up for your account. What is going to happen?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-ya-no-permite-contratar-su-cuenta-que-va-a-pasar/,09/04/2024,"Orange Bank has closed the account contracting process after selling it to BNP Paribas, and existing clients will be migrated to Cetelem.
A statement appears on its website indicating that ""at this time it is not possible to become an Orange Bank customer.""
In addition, it reports that ""both entities will work together to support clients in their transition during 2024 to Cetelem's digital banking solutions.""
Until they are migrated, ""customers can continue to use their Orange Bank accounts and services as normal.""
It is not known yet. The bank has not yet communicated anything to customers. However, we can speculate knowing the existing offers.
To begin with, if it no longer allows you to sign up for an account at Orange Bank, it means that it is headed to its end. The bank already indicates that clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
If we compare the conditions of Orange Bank, Cetelem and MoneyGo (from Yoigo/Xfera with Cetelem support), we see that Cetelem loses.
On the other hand, Orange Bank and Money Go are very similar. Account decently remunerated, without commissions and rewarding the customers of its mobile operator.
If the bank decides on Cetelem's solution, many clients will leave and the purchase and investment of money will be of almost no use.
The normal thing would be to provide some continuity in the conditions so that Orange Bank clients do not run away. What do you believe?
Unless Cetelem integrates the Bizum service available in Orange Bank, clients will no longer be able to use this very useful service when they are transferred to Cetelem.
From the outset, the bank must notify the change of conditions 2 months in advance. Then we can decide what to do and there is enough time to complete the necessary tasks before closing the account.
Among those tasks is moving all your money from the bank to other entities, from both accounts: checking account and savings account.
Move the receipts that you have direct debit at the bank, and thus you will avoid inconveniences of returned receipts.
The account closing process is quite simple. You just have to start a conversation via chat in the Orange Bank APP and an operator will help you in the process.


Due to the disappearance of Orange Bank, and the transfer of clients to Cetelem, the first ""unknown"" problems of this entity appear.
Today we echo a complaint from one of our users and new Cetelem client who complains about the maximum limit that the entity allows in daily transfers.
This limit, of €30,000, is considered insufficient, and that the entity should modify or remove.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
18,Openbank once again offers a deposit at 3.15% APR and 12 months with the feint trick,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/openbank-vuelve-a-ofrecer-un-deposito-al-315-tae-y-a-12-meses-con-el-truco-de-amago/,08/04/2024,"Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being a much higher offer than what is generally offered:
Keep in mind that the exclusive deposit is for the money that is already in the bank and does not require payroll or anything. He just wants you not to take the money to another bank. You can see the comparison below.
It consists of starting the process of a transfer to another entity:

At the beginning of February, Openbank offered an Exclusive Deposit, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR, but today we tested it again and the offer has been deflated to a paltry 2% APR, the same profitability as its widespread supply for new money."
19,EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR for an indefinite period,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-banco-ha-prorrogado-por-tiempo-indefinido-sus-depositos-al-31-tae/,08/04/2024,"EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been valid since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue until further notice.
The big problem with your deposits is that early cancellations are not allowed:
EBN, since October 1, 2023, offers its Remunerated Account at 3% APR and for all clients. Too bad it's only for the first €10,000:
The characteristics of your account are:
NOTE: If you put, for example, €60,000 in the bank: the first €10,000 is remunerated at 3% APR; The next €40,000 is remunerated at 1.5% APR and the rest (€10,000 is not remunerated).
This account is without commissions, without demands. It is a savings account so it does not accept direct debits, debits, or payment operations using credit or debit cards.


EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here).
EBN bank increases the profitability of several of its deposits for Black Friday, which will last between November 16 and 27.
This extra profitability, of up to 3.6% APR, affects fixed terms of 4, 12 and 24 months and will be very close to the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big ( see here)."

Will there be changes the next day?
The bank has not touched its products since January 16, 2024, when the profitability of one of its products (2-year deposit) first decreased. The entity has been uploading its products non-stop since May 2022.
Since January, the bank has renewed the contracting period for its products twice, do you think they will go down, go up or make a new extension?
We believe that there is a good chance of a drop, especially in the savings account.
A second option could be a new extension, and a rate increase is almost impossible, but if it did, it would take away all the free liabilities of this bank's customer profile.

21,Haitong lowers its deposits to 6 and 9 months. Maintain the maximum 3.55% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/haitong-baja-sus-depositos-a-6-y-9-meses-conserva-el-maximo-del-355-tae/,04/04/2024,"Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
This entity, which was at the top of the ranking of the most profitable deposits, has been losing steam in 2024.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and in February up to 3.55% APR.
In 2023, it clearly surpassed Renault Bank in its 2-year fixed term, but its current 3.49% APR is practically the same as what Renault Bank offers, which is without intermediaries.
Haitong is a Portuguese entity (Portuguese FGD), which markets its products via the Raisin platform, but unlike the rest of the banks, it has a branch in Spain, which gives it a great advantage.
Taking out a deposit in Haitong is as if you were doing it at ING or Orange Bank. You will have personal income tax withholdings and your data will be communicated to the Tax Agency like any other Spanish bank.
Another issue is whether or not you trust the bank. Haitong is the former Banco Espirito Santo that was acquired by the Chinese group Haitong Securities and which now markets deposits through Raisin.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.
>> See more information here
The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting.
Finally, Haitong Bank has cut the profitability of absolutely all its deposits, in addition to the 1-year term announced by Raisin.
With this reduction, the bank loses the 4% APR level that it had been offering for months. Specifically, since July 2023.
Now the maximum that the bank offers is 3.95% APR for a 1-year term and 3.78% APR for a 2-year term, which are also the most interesting due to the downward trend in rates."

Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers.""
If the following information is of interest to you to prepare a news item, I have read that on other occasions as a result of complaints from readers it has also been published. In this case it is the ""Multitrame Savings Time"" promotion for balance increases in both accounts currents as in deposits:
The bases are very clear in this regard, it was enough for it to be new money, meet the dates, and the amount of one of the tranches.
There are testimonies from some clients who collected it within the period established in the rules: in the second half of March.
And many testimonies from other clients (among which I am) that we contracted a deposit combining it with the campaign (resulting in total an extra rate on par with the competition's remuneration), and now they have left us without the promotion payment . Until now, by phone they open a file for you and we will see. It is not very serious that a bank with Openbank's reputation massively fails to comply with one of its campaigns, and we have to individually claim and fight for something that belongs to us, wasting time on calls, days without knowing what happens with our files for 35 or 50 euros in the most cases, when what they would have to do is acknowledge their failure and correct it for all customers.
You can find more information in the rankia thread titled: ""Someone has received the subscription for the OPEN BANK Multitrade Savings Time promotion.""
And I link the bases here.
Thank you for your work and greetings.
To access this campaign, customers had to open an account before February 19, 2024 inclusive, enter the promotional code 'MULTIAHORRO', and increase their total balance in accounts or deposits by an amount equal to or greater than 10,000 euros between 29 November 2023 and February 19, 2024, both inclusive.
The bank offered clients and non-clients up to 500 euros to increase their balance in accounts or deposits:
The payment will be made in the second half of March 2024. Therefore, clients should have already received their money; but we also know that on many occasions Openbank is late in these payments.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

23,Am I required to file the declaration? Is there anything I should do if I am exempt?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/tengo-que-hacer-la-declaracion-puedo-presentarlo-si-me-sale-a-devolver/,03/04/2024,"Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
To know whether or not a person is exempt from making the Declaration, his or her sources of income must be taken into account, since there are limits that must not be exceeded. These limits are identical for individual and joint taxation.
People who have only obtained income from the following sources are exempt from personal income tax and, therefore, are not required to submit an Income Tax Return:
1. WORK PERFORMANCE
The general rule is that those people who do not earn more than €22,000 annually are exempt from filing the Tax Return, so that:
1.- Taxpayers who have obtained income from work up to the limit of €22,000 per year will not have to declare when they come from a single payer.
Or if the taxpayer had income from more than one payer, without exceeding the limit of €22,000 and was in one of the following two situations:
a).- That the sum of the amounts received from the second and remaining payers does not exceed a total of €1,500 per year.
b).- That their only income from work consists of the passive benefits referred to in article 17.2.a) of the Tax Law.
2.- The income limit is €15,000 in the following cases:
2. PERFORMANCE ON MOVABLE CAPITAL
Full income from movable capital and capital gains, provided that they have been subject to withholding and do not exceed the limit of €1,600 per year.
3. IMPUTED REAL ESTATE INCOME
Full income from movable capital not subject to withholding derived from Treasury bills and subsidies for the acquisition of official protection or appraised price, with the joint limit of €1,000 per year.
4. SPECIAL CASES
Those who obtained full income from work, capital or economic activities in 2023, or capital gains that together do not exceed €1,000, or those who have exclusively had capital losses of less than €500, will not have to submit a declaration.
Recipients of the Minimum Living Income (IMV) are required to submit the income tax return, regardless of their income.
The self-employed are also required to present if they have obtained income of more than 1,000 euros, whether from economic activities or real estate income.
Even if you are exempt from filing the declaration, it is advisable to request the Draft to verify if your declaration is to be returned or paid.
In the first case, you must confirm the draft since the Treasury will return money and otherwise, not confirm it. The request or review of the draft does not obligate the declaration to be made.
Finally, if the taxpayer has the right to deductions, it is also advisable to complete the Declaration, since it will surely be returned; at least you should see the draft to verify this fact.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The Tax Agency has already made their tax data available to taxpayers on the Treasury website, 2 weeks before the start of the 2023 income campaign (April 3, 2024, see income calendar here).
With this data, the income simulator (Renta Web Open, see here), we can anticipate what this year will bring us: we will have to pay or the Treasury will refund us.
With just over 1 month left until the start of the 2023 income campaign, the Treasury has already made the “Renta WEB Open” program available to taxpayers.

The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
The new conditions of these products are as follows:
The welcome deposit, which suffered a decrease last month from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR, remains as is, unchanged.
The previous changes made by the bank are:
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
The bank has not yet established a marketing period for this product.
Banco BIG offers in its Big BIG Account at 1.5% APR:
The Banco Big paid account is commission-free and has a Spanish IBAN, but under the Portuguese FGD. It is ING-style, but its headquarters are in Portugal.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers.
Yes, the usual shit... deposit rates drop and banks begin to take advantage of people's misinformation to sneak in products they don't want attached to supposedly high-profit deposits.
This is how Banco BIG has been for a few days with its deposit at 5% APR and now MyInvestor with its deposit at 4% APR."

This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it is always good to have one more alternative:
If you have or contract an automated portfolio with a minimum of €150, the entity offers you a 4% APR for 3 months.
During the month of November 2023, MyInvestor raised its savings account from 2% APR to 2.5% APR and for a maximum remuneration that goes from €50,000 to €70,000.
The account characteristics are:
You can earn 2.5% APR indefinitely if you invest in:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.

28,"Cetelem deposits, up to 4% APR, would be interesting if not on their own",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/los-depositos-de-cetelem-hasta-4-tae-serian-interesantes-si-no-fuera-por-su-cuenta/,01/04/2024,"Cetelem continues trying to capture liabilities with its 4 deposits of up to 4% APR for everyone: new or existing clients.
Until recently, the French entity only had a high-remuneration savings account, up to 3% APR, with a big ""but"", it charges commissions, which those savers who decide to contract their deposits will have to bear.
These products have only been on the market for a few weeks. There are 4 deposits with a term of 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, the most profitable being the shortest term, at 4% APR; and the least profitable, the longest term, at 3.1% APR:
The characteristics of these deposits are:
We believe that the most interesting is the 3-month deposit and 4% APR. The others are equal/surpassed, for example by facto or Renault Bank or Banco Big and do not have the drawback of having an account associated with commissions.
An advantage that we highlight about Cetelem deposits is that it allows early cancellations, something that neither Facto nor Renault Bank allow; but Big Bank, yes.
To contract your deposits, you need to have a Ceteltem account. This account is paid and has commissions. Both features are linked:
Both plans have an initial bonus if you are a new customer of €2 until June 30, 2024. In addition, the Premium Plan gives you €20 gross welcome.
Let's hope that with the acquisition of Orange Bank and given the possibility of losing clients, the bank decides to leave the account as close as possible to the newly acquired entity:
Worth? Tell me yourselves. We avoid commissions, having similar offers in Facto, Renault Bank or Banco Big among others, but perhaps if you make a large investment it is worth that 4% APR.
We will see what the bank does after integrating Orange Bank into Cetelem...


Cetelem begins to capture deposits, launching 4 fixed terms from 3 to 18 months and up to 4% APR. They are quite interesting products except for one ""but.""
They are deposits that do not require anything, only that you sign up for a Celetem account, which is where the catch lies, which we will detail below.
Don't be scared. Orange Bank is NOT closing, or going bankrupt, or anything like that.
What happens is that Orange, the company on which it depends, no longer wants to continue in the retail banking adventure and is going to sell it after only 3 and a half years.
Should we worry? How will it affect customers?"

On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
In this regard, in January, OCU filed a complaint with the Customer Ombudsman, as well as with the Bank of Spain to take action on the matter, since it discriminates against users and calls into question the free circulation of capital. the European Union. We don't think it will have any effect.
The only thing we have left is to denounce these situations and bring shame to these banks. We already warned of this shameful mistreatment in November 2023 (see here).
The truth is that the ""Flexible Deposit"" is quite interesting, especially before the drop, since it is linked to a ""Current account without commissions forever"", very similar to the online account that it sells here in Spain:
And the characteristics of the tank were especially good, and now it has been decaffeinated a little.
Now the paid account offers higher profitability than the deposit: at 4% APR until January 31, 2025:

Additionally, 4% cashback on the first €200 of purchases each month until January 31, 2025 by subscribing to the BBVA account before 04/15/2024.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions.
OCU, in its monthly magazine of January 2024, denounces that BBVA offers Italian clients a 1-year deposit at 4.25% APR for new clients, and a commission-free savings account at 4% APR, while here, nothing you are welcome."

Now it offers a maximum of 2.40% APR instead of the 2.55% APR that it had been offering.
It is the fourth consecutive drop in these products that were launched in the month of November, giving a maximum of 3% APR. With the successive decreases: in January, February, at the beginning of March and now, it remains at 2.4% APR.
This time the decreases, of 0.15 percentage points, only affect the deposits with the highest investment, from €100,000, and the most profitable.
These deposits are available from €1, and do not ask for new money as this bank normally requires:
The rest of the characteristics of this deposit are:
ING offers its Orange Account up to 1.5% APR if you also have the Payroll Account:


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

31,"CA Auto Bank slightly increases the profitability of its deposits, up to 3.55% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ca-auto-bank-sube-ligeramente-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos/,25/03/2024,"The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR).
The problem with the previous rates was that it did not even exceed the offer from Renault Bank (3.44% APR), which does not need the 720 model, but it corrects that problem with this slight increase, although we believe it is insufficient.
The bank has also increased the minimum investment from €10,000 to €20,000, leaving its characteristics as follows:
We remind you that hiring a deposit at Auto Bank, your money is in Italy, protected by the Italian FGD and you have some obligations with the Tax Agency:
Furthermore, just by having the money abroad and obtaining interest without withholding in Spain, you are required to file your income tax return annually.
Crédit Agricole Auto Bank belongs to the Crédit Agricole group, the tenth banking group in the world and the leader in Europe in terms of number of clients.
With operations in 19 European countries, Crédit Agricole Auto Bank is positioned as one of the leading providers of vehicle financing, leasing and mobility services.
Founded in 1925, the bank has almost a century of experience in the European automobile industry.
It offers a wide variety of financial, rental and insurance services in collaboration with more than 50 brands.
CA Auto Bank, which suspended the contracting of its deposits at the beginning of February due to the ""high number of requests"", reactivates the contracting of its deposits, but at a significantly lower profitability.
That 4.12% APR that it offered at its launch in January 2024 quickly disappeared. Now, at most, the bank offers a 2-year deposit and a 3.34% APR, which we do not believe will saturate the entity with requests again.
""Due to the high number of applications received by CA Auto Bank, new applications will temporarily not be accepted,"" is how it appears on the Raisin website dedicated to the products of this entity recently launched via this platform.
In this way, the Auto Bank offer goes on standby in less than 2 weeks after its launch. The truth is that the interest rate offered by this bank was very attractive.
Crédit Agricole Auto Bank, the subsidiary of Crédit Agricole, has opened a branch in Spain and begins to offer high-profit deposits. Up to 4.2% APR.
The terms range from 6 months with a 4% APR, passed through 1 (4.1% APR), 2 (the most profitable at 4.2% APR), 3 (4.1% APR), 4 (4% APR) and a maximum of 5 years (3.90% APR)."
32,"Revolut now ""gives"" 3.97% APR on its Flexible Account",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/revolut-ahora-da-el-397-tae-en-su-cuenta-flexible/,25/03/2024,"The profitability of the Revolut Flexible Account reached up to 3.97% as of January 15, 2024, which the entity announces on its website.
That almost 4% APR, which you add to the ""account"" that ""pays interest daily"" and ""withdraw funds when you need it"", makes many not resist the temptation.
In fact, as of December, there were more than 350 million euros that Revolut had raised among Spanish savers, according to a press release issued by the bank itself.
In fact, our country is where it has raised the most money, ahead of 21 other countries where it has a presence.
But be careful, there is a trick.
To begin with, it is NOT a bank account and is not covered by the FGD. It is an investment product, more specifically a Monetary Fund.
Therefore, the money you invest in that ""account"" does not remain in Revolut as liquid money, but in securities referenced to assets that will fluctuate.
The bank itself clearly warns that ""the value of investments can fluctuate and you may receive less than the original investment or lose the full value of the initial investment.""
Furthermore, ""past performance and forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future results.""
And finally he washes his hands saying that the bank ""does not provide investment advice, so, as an individual investor, you will have to make your own decisions or seek independent advice if you are not sure that an investment is suitable or suitable for you."" .
The above in small print, but in GIGANTE it says: ""Your security first"", which makes us feel safe in our investment, but NO, that security is ""advanced protection against fraud, strict security functionalities and security service."" 24/7 customer service.
Revolut's solvency affects the Revolut Account, which is a traditional bank account.
The money we put in that account, the bank invests in whatever it considers, leaving a small reserve for reimbursements.
In case the bank does it wrong, and goes bankrupt, the money deposited in this account is guaranteed up to €100,000 per person by the FGD, in this case the Lithuanian one.
In the case of the Flexible Account, it is totally different. You put the money in the account, and the bank invests it in a Monetary Fund and you are the owner of said participation.
Revolut is simply an intermediary that takes your money and invests it. In the event of Revolut bankruptcy, you should not worry, you have the fund shares.
In short, the money in the Flexible Account is in a separate accounting of the bank. You have no bank risk.
The risk of this account is what you invest the money in. By putting money in this account you become an investor, in this case of a monetary fund.
A monetary fund obtains its profitability from the positive evolution of interest rates. There are no more risks if you invest in Euros. This is not the case if, for example, you invest in dollars, you would also be exposed to the exchange rate.
Currently, the outlook for the evolution of the interest rate is positive, so everything will be fine for these funds as long as the situation persists.
But be careful, the ECB has already said that it intends to lower interest rates in spring if the moderation of inflation is confirmed.
Revolut offers great liquidity to the Flexible Account, but everything can change.
It indicates that it allows you to withdraw funds at any time, but establishes a daily limit of 5 million euros. Be careful, it is not per client, but in TOTAL. And currently there are 350 million euros saved from Spanish savers.
But what happens if interest rates suddenly start to fall and your profitability drops or even starts to lose. People will want to withdraw their funds... Don't you see the problem?
Monetary funds are not liquid money, but are invested in things (public treasury, company debt...) and although they have very long payment terms, you must wait until they mature, and if you want it sooner, someone has to buy it from you and It will be at the price that they want to buy it from you. You won't know it, but it will translate into the amount of money that Revolut returns to you.
If you read the information on their website, everything is confusing, and they continually review SAVINGS, SAVINGS, SAVINGS. But it really is an investment.
The general press does not help either, they only echo the bank's statement and are misleading. They talk about accounts, deposits, savings, and NO. We repeat, it is an investment.
As an investor, although with a more conservative profile, you must be aware of things; From one day to the next everything can change, it will depend on the monetary policy of the ECB, and if you invest in dollars or pounds... well, even more worried about the currency exchange rate.
…and from www.tucapital.es we ask ourselves: What need does a saver have to get into this mess by having short-term deposits that earn the same amount right now?
We remind you that in 2017, 40 of the 49 super-safe monetary funds lost money (see here).


More than 350 million euros has been captured by Revolut in its Flexible Account among Spanish savers according to a press release issued by the bank itself.
There are 350 million euros invested in a monetary fund that people do not know and think is a traditional account.
If you read a Revolut news item in the press and see that it offers a 3.7% APR. Be careful.
Your normal account, the Revolut, if it is a traditional bank account, with FGD and services. But the Flexible account, the one that gives you 3.7% APR, is not a bank account.
We made it clear in our previous post that the 3.4% Revolut account is NOT a bank account and not covered by the FGD. It is an investment product, more specifically a Monetary Fund.
We explain the risks."
33,"Next week, the last to present the Model 720",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/la-proxima-semana-la-ultima-para-presentar-el-modelo-720-si-has-tenido-dinero-en-el-extranjero/,21/03/2024,"All of you who have had more than €50,000 as of December 31, 2023 have to present form 720 and you have until April 1 to do so.
If you do not present it or present it after the deadline, having the obligation, you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency.
Taxpayers who own any of the following groups of assets abroad that total more than 50,000 euros as of December 31, 2023 will be required to submit this informative return:
In short, if the total of each of the 3 previous groups of assets does not exceed 50,000 euros as of December 31 of each year, you are not required to present form 720.
Once Form 720 is presented for the first time, in subsequent years, it will only be mandatory when any of the joint balances of the three different blocks of assets mentioned above have experienced an increase of more than 20,000 euros compared to those that determined the presentation of the last statement.
As an example of affected savers, they are people who had contracted Raisin deposits, except Haitong, which is an entity with a branch in Spain.
It is quite simple to fill out the model, we have explained it in detail in a previously published article. Read here
Yes, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared it illegal due to the ""disproportionate"" fines that undermine the free movement of capital in the European Union.
After the ruling, the government corrected these defects by approving a new sanctioning regime, avoiding the illegality declared by the CJEU.
The obligation remains in force.
Since 2022 and after the CJEU ruling, the sanctions that apply to form 720 are the same as the rest of the Tax Agency's sanctions.
As it is an informative model, the sanctions are:
1. If requested by the Treasury, voluntarily submitting it after the deadline:
The penalty will be 100 euros, and 10 euros for each data or set of data in the informative return, with limits established between 150 and 10,000 euros.
2. With a Treasury requirement
The penalty will be 200 euros and 20 euros for each data or set of data in the informative declaration with limits established between 300 and 20,000 euros.
Novum Bank is offering Spanish savers 2 high-yield deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months and at 3.5% APR and 3.9% APR respectively.
These are bank deposits that can be contracted from €10,000 and up to a maximum of €100,000; always covered by the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD), in this case of Malta.
Many taxpayers avoid the annual procedure of submitting the income tax return if they are within certain income limits and types of income, because the Treasury considers that adequate withholdings have been applied to these people.
However, if you have had any deposit from the Raisin platform, except Haigton Sucusal in Spain, you will have obtained interest that has NOT been declared to the Spanish Tax Agency, and therefore, you have the obligation to file your income tax return and add said interests obtained abroad.
""Due to the high number of applications received by CA Auto Bank, new applications will temporarily not be accepted,"" is how it appears on the Raisin website dedicated to the products of this entity recently launched via this platform.
In this way, the Auto Bank offer goes on standby in less than 2 weeks after its launch. The truth is that the interest rate offered by this bank was very attractive."

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.

38,5 signs that indicate a casino is worth it,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/5-senales-que-indican-que-un-casino-vale-la-pena/,20/03/2024,"Casinos have been a very popular means of entertainment for years in Spain, so much so that it is possible to visit not only physical establishments to play slots and table games, but we can also do so through web portals in what are known as casinos. online.
However, when we talk about these online operators, there are so many options that choosing the best one according to our tastes can be quite an odyssey, and that is where this reading comes in. Here we will discuss the 5 elements that differentiate a mediocre casino from a great one. Don't leave your screen!
There are dozens of portals on the Internet dedicated to analyzing online betting platforms with the purpose of allowing readers to compare them and choose their favorites according to their criteria.
If you want to know one of the best, then visit online-casino-espana.es, a portal where you can compare some of the best Spanish online casinos and find out the type of games they contain.
Let's be honest; Playing slots or other games is the main objective we have when visiting this platform, so having variety and quality in a game catalog should always be the norm. Usually, a casino with 1000 games from famous providers like Pragmatic Play, Playtech or MGA are the best places to bet.
Of course, there is always the possibility of getting the odd prize, but you should not take your eyes off the goal of these games: to have fun and be entertained.
Spain is one of the strictest countries in the field of betting, so many of its services (including its bonuses) are subject to certain regulations, such as the one established a little over a year ago in Royal Decree 958/2020. .
Such decree indicates that new players cannot claim bonuses unless they have a verified account and at least 30 days from completing said verification. If a bonus meets this parameter, then it is worth going for it.
It doesn't matter if you are one of those who bet specifically with one payment method, having multiple options to deposit and withdraw funds is always well received by players. The good thing is that almost all sites accept credit cards and PayPal, which are the most popular methods in Spain.
It is also important to consider the time it takes to make such transactions, as well as your deposit and withdrawal limits.
Last but not least, the casino must manage measures that serve as protection for its customers, and in this aspect there are two main factors to consider: the existence of several responsible gaming tools and the availability of a support team.
It is important to remember that betting is for entertainment and not a way to make money, so while it is possible to win at casino games, this should never be seen as a source of income. Play responsibly!
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun. However, beyond the entertainment, there are valuable lessons about managing personal finances. Each decision made in roulette or blackjack, for example, contains strategies applicable not only in the game, but also in our daily finances.
In the wide universe of online gaming, Nomini Casino shines as an oasis of fun and excitement. In an environment where the daily routine can be tedious, having a trustworthy and entertaining space to relax is essential.
With a wide variety of games ranging from the most popular slots to classic table games, this online casino offers a unique gaming experience for every type of player."

Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco.
Evo Banco increases the profitability of its Smart Account from 2.5% APR to 2.85% APR, and guarantees that profitability for more than 1 year; but only for new clients.
The profitability of 2.85% APR will be given to you until January 31, 2025, and only from February 2025 onwards, the bank will apply the general conditions of all clients, which is currently not competitive at all."

This account, which allows you to obtain a remuneration of up to 2,225 euros for the first two years, is available within Plan 0 of the “Bankinter Business Plan”.
“Bankinter Business Plan” establishes 3 pricing levels:
To access Plan 0 it is necessary to carry out a minimum operation between these six possible options:
All plans have an account, cards, personal tutor, SEPA transfers, check deposits, SEPA debits; in addition to electronic payments: POS with a discount rate of 0.45%; o International Business services: currency account and access to the currency broker with real-time quotes.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower.
Some users of our website have sent us to analyze the Bankinter Ibex 35 Structured Deposit. At the outset we tell you that these products are misleading and normally the customer does not win."
49,"Orange Bank will be Cetelem, how will it end? What will happen to MoneyGo-Cetelem?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-sera-cetelem-que-pasara-con-moneygo-cetelem/,07/03/2024,"As you already know and we have commented on this website, BNP Paribas has bought Orange Bank's business and will transfer its clients to Cetelem, but for now the two coexist.
On the other hand, Cetelem is supporting Yoigo/Xfera and its MoneyGo Account, an account very similar to that of Orange Bank. What will happen? Let's compare the products and figure out how the 3 accounts could end up.
At the moment, in our opinion, a saver could have all 3 accounts contracted without problems.
Orange Bank, for now, remains independent from Cetelem and with a different IBAN, in fact they are under a different FGD: Orange Bank, French FGD; and Cetelem, FGD Spanish. This will be the case until it integrates Orange Bank services into Celetem, which will be done throughout 2024. At the moment, clients have not yet received any communication from the bank.
If you go to Orange Bank, the process of contracting the Orange Bank Account is still in force and is, therefore, compatible with that of Cetelem, as it has been until now. We repeat, we do not know how long this situation will last and how it will all end.
On the other hand, we have Money Go, which is a Cetelem product marketed by Xfera C.F, and in collaboration with Yoigo. We believe that it tries to replicate Orange Bank's business: account, mobile financing, in this case Yoigo, etc.; and the offer is independent of Cetelem and even more so of the current Orange Bank.
Putting all the characteristics of the 3 accounts, we will see similarities:
NOTE: If you are on the mobile version, please put it in landscape mode to see the full table.
We see that Orange Bank and Money Go are very similar. Account decently remunerated, without commissions and rewarding the customers of its mobile operator.
On the other hand, Cetelem's model is different, it charges you more or less commissions to give you more or less.
Would it be feasible to think that the final solution will be a hybrid between Orange Bank and MoneyGo? We believe it would be possible. An Orange Bank customer would not be very bothered by the conditions of Money Go, but they would be bothered by those of Cetelem. If we were Cetelem, I would make this decision. What do you believe?


Due to the disappearance of Orange Bank, and the transfer of clients to Cetelem, the first ""unknown"" problems of this entity appear.
Today we echo a complaint from one of our users and new Cetelem client who complains about the maximum limit that the entity allows in daily transfers.
This limit, of €30,000, is considered insufficient, and that the entity should modify or remove.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

The entity has extended the contracting period for this account also until May 6, 2024.


Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?
If you have a Savings Account opened in Wizink without it being linked to a deposit, starting tomorrow, February 15, it will be remunerated at 2.3% APR, the same as the bank gives for a 25-month deposit. term.
Accounts that were contracted by opening a deposit will also increase, but only up to 1% APR, as we indicated yesterday."

This product was in force until May 2023 and at 4% APR, and the bank relaunched it in October 2023 at 4.25% APR, now it suffers a small cut to 4.1% APR .
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
The bank has not yet established a marketing period for this product.
Banco BIG offers in its Big BIG Account at 1.5% APR:
The Banco Big paid account is commission-free and has a Spanish IBAN, but under the Portuguese FGD. It is ING-style, but its headquarters are in Portugal.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Yes, the usual shit... deposit rates drop and banks begin to take advantage of people's misinformation to sneak in products they don't want attached to supposedly high-profit deposits.
This is how Banco BIG has been for a few days with its deposit at 5% APR and now MyInvestor with its deposit at 4% APR."

It will offer an account, the B100 account, without commissions, with a card and all the services, the same as Orange Bank.
If you want to save, it gives you a paid account at 2.7% APR in the Save account, better than Orange Bank (2% APR), and is a short distance from the Renault Bank Account (2.89% APR).
If you also take care of yourself, it gives you a 3.4% APR on the Heath account. For that, you have to meet some physical well-being goals.
As an additional advantage of B100, it is from Abanca, a 100% Spanish entity, and therefore is under the Spanish FGD, unlike Orange Bank or Renault Bank which are under the French FGD.
Opening is simple, you only need a mobile phone to download an app and a DNI or NIE that shows that you are of legal age and that you reside in Spain.
It is a checking account for your daily life with no maintenance or administration fees.
It also does not charge you for transfers in the euro zone, transfers, Bizum, card...
It is an account without remuneration, without requiring anything in return; It also gives you a card with no fees for issuance, renewal, or currency exchange abroad when you use it.
As for withdrawing cash with the card, you can do it for free as many times as you want at the Abanca ATM network.
Additionally, you have 2 free times a month (3 Orange Bank) at any ATM in the Euro 6000 network, the Euro Automatic Cash network, or from Caixabank, Sabadell, Bankinter, Caja Ingenieros or Caja Arquitecto ATMs (Orange Bank at any ATM ).
It is a paid account:
The Health account is the same as the Save account, but it gives you a little more profitability if you meet health goals.
To deposit money into this account you will have to choose a daily step goal from several options and select an amount to transfer from your B100 Account, between €1 and €30 per day.
The transfer is automatic if you meet the objectives.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM."

They are quite interesting products except for one ""but.""
They are deposits that do not require anything, only that you sign up for a Celetem account, which is where the catch lies, which we will detail below.
The profitability is quite good, especially for short terms:
In addition, it allows early cancellations, losing only the interest generated and the amount of the investment can be any, from the first euro.
In summary:
Cetelem currently charges commissions for its checking account. It offers 2 plans with different commissions and different returns:
As you can see in the table, Orange Bank appears, and it is because during 2024, Orange Bank clients will switch to Cetelem.
Which offer will prevail? Orange Bank or Cetelem? If it is Orange Bank, the offer will be very good.
On the other hand, if Cetelem prevails, you already know that on this website we do not like commissions. Anyway, let's analyze its opportunity cost (see here) compared to, for example, Renault Bank.
Most of you who read us know that Renault Bank works quite well, pays interest on time and is continually raising its rates and is always among the most profitable on the market.
Currently, the French entity gives a 2.89% APR (2.85% TIN) without commissions and nothing strange, compared to the 3% APR (2.96% TIN) of the Celetem premium plan with a commission of €3 per month (rounding).
So for example, let's analyze for different amounts of investments, logically, we will subtract the interest generated, the bank commissions:
Note 1: the data are monthly interest settlements and net (after withholdings).
Note 2: You earn €20 gross welcome bonus and in addition, until June 2024 you get €1 more per month for the reduced commission.
We observed that:
So, except for an initial period, Renault Bank is almost always better, which also offers a 2-year deposit at 3.44% APR, which is more profitable than Cetelem's 18-month deposit (3.1% APR), and now, long-term deposits are advisable due to lower rates.
However, if you want the short term for whatever reasons, it is possible that Cetelem is better for its 4% APR deposit and 3-month term.
What are you left with?


Cetelem continues trying to capture liabilities with its 4 deposits of up to 4% APR for everyone: new or existing clients.
These products have only been on the market for a few weeks. There are 4 deposits with a term of 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, the most profitable being the shortest term, at 4% APR; and the least profitable, the longest term, at 3.1% APR
Don't be scared. Orange Bank is NOT closing, or going bankrupt, or anything like that.
What happens is that Orange, the company on which it depends, no longer wants to continue in the retail banking adventure and is going to sell it after only 3 and a half years.
Should we worry? How will it affect customers?"

That 4.12% APR that it offered at its launch in January 2024 quickly disappeared. Now, at most, the bank offers 3.45% APR for 6 or 12 months and 2 years at 3.34% APR, with which we do not believe it will saturate the entity with requests again.
It is even less than what Renault Bank gives (3.44% APR), which does not need intermediaries and has been working well for quite some time in Spain.
In less than 2 months it has been collecting deposits in Spain and it is almost like night and day:
The characteristics of these deposits are:
We remind you that hiring a deposit at Auto Bank, your money is in Italy, protected by the Italian FGD and you have some obligations with the Tax Agency:
Furthermore, just by having the money abroad and obtaining interest without withholding in Spain, you are required to file your income tax return annually.
Crédit Agricole Auto Bank belongs to the Crédit Agricole group, the tenth banking group in the world and the leader in Europe in terms of number of clients.
With operations in 19 European countries, Crédit Agricole Auto Bank is positioned as one of the leading providers of vehicle financing, leasing and mobility services.
Founded in 1925, the bank has almost a century of experience in the European automobile industry.
It offers a wide variety of financial, rental and insurance services in collaboration with more than 50 brands.


The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR).
""Due to the high number of applications received by CA Auto Bank, new applications will temporarily not be accepted,"" is how it appears on the Raisin website dedicated to the products of this entity recently launched via this platform.
In this way, the Auto Bank offer goes on standby in less than 2 weeks after its launch. The truth is that the interest rate offered by this bank was very attractive.
Crédit Agricole Auto Bank, the subsidiary of Crédit Agricole, has opened a branch in Spain and begins to offer high-profit deposits. Up to 4.2% APR.
The terms range from 6 months with a 4% APR, passed through 1 (4.1% APR), 2 (the most profitable at 4.2% APR), 3 (4.1% APR), 4 (4% APR) and a maximum of 5 years (3.90% APR)."

In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
For 2 years, the bank offers 3.49% APR, practically the same as what Renault Bank offers, which is without intermediaries.
Haitong is a Portuguese entity (Portuguese FGD), which markets its products via the Raisin platform, but unlike the rest of the banks, it has a branch in Spain, which gives it a great advantage.
Taking out a deposit in Haitong is as if you were doing it at ING or Orange Bank. You will have personal income tax withholdings and your data will be communicated to the Tax Agency like any other Spanish bank.
Another issue is whether or not you trust the bank. Haitong is the former Banco Espirito Santo that was acquired by the Chinese group Haitong Securities and which now markets deposits through Raisin.

The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting.
Finally, Haitong Bank has cut the profitability of absolutely all its deposits, in addition to the 1-year term announced by Raisin.
With this reduction, the bank loses the 4% APR level that it had been offering for months. Specifically, since July 2023.
Now the maximum that the bank offers is 3.95% APR for a 1-year term and 3.78% APR for a 2-year term, which are also the most interesting due to the downward trend in rates."

In order to consult this data, and subsequently access the Web Rent, the first step, in most cases, is to obtain the reference number.
This number can be obtained through the REN0 program which, logically, requires identity verification.
The simplest way, without the need for electronic certificates or registration in the Treasury authentication system, Cl@ave PIN, is through a box for the previous year's declaration that is available to everyone:
There are special cases that the program will automatically detect and ask you for other information:
In these cases, the program will ask you for the last 5 digits of an IBAN of a bank account in which you are the owner.
The reference number obtained is valid until the beginning of the next rental campaign, when you will have to request a new one.
You can start the process again and obtain a new reference number.
NOTE: If you have any questions, you can ask them in the comments. Together we can guide you.
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The Tax Agency has already made their tax data available to taxpayers on the Treasury website, 2 weeks before the start of the 2023 income campaign (April 3, 2024, see income calendar here).
With this data, the income simulator (Renta Web Open, see here), we can anticipate what this year will bring us: we will have to pay or the Treasury will refund us."
61,"Confirmed, Orange Bank will be Cetelem",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/confirmado-orange-bank-sera-cetelem/,27/02/2024,"Finally, it has been confirmed that BNP Paribas has bought the business of Orange Bank in both Spain and France.
In this way, Orange Bank clients in Spain will become Cetelem clients.
According to the statement, the commercial agreement they have reached will offer a ""continuity solution"" to Orange Bank clients in Spain, and they will work throughout 2024 to make the transition to Cetelem's digital banking solutions.
We'll see how it turns out definitively, but currently, there are quite a few things we don't like about Celetem, and we fear it will get worse:
As you can see, Orange Bank's offer is clearly better than the Cetelem Plan, and many will even like it more than the Premium plan as it has no commissions even if it rents a little less.
We will see what decisions they will make about the products. But we can predict that if they change, even very significantly, the Orange Bank savings account, the stampede will be monumental.


Due to the disappearance of Orange Bank, and the transfer of clients to Cetelem, the first ""unknown"" problems of this entity appear.
Today we echo a complaint from one of our users and new Cetelem client who complains about the maximum limit that the entity allows in daily transfers.
This limit, of €30,000, is considered insufficient, and that the entity should modify or remove.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
62,"Banca March relaunches its Avantio Flexible Deposit, 12 months and now at 3% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banca-march-relanza-su-deposito-flexible-avantio-a-12-meses-y-ahora-al-3-tae/,27/02/2024,"Banca March relaunches the Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and now at 3% APR for new digital clients.
It represents a reduction of 0.3 percentage points compared to what the bank offered until December 31, 2023.
The bank does not require large capital to hire, from €10,000; and allows early cancellations. In this case, furthermore, the bank continues to compensate you for your money, at 1% APR instead of 3%.
This product is exclusively for new customers who open the Avantio account through digital channels.
The characteristics of this fixed term are:
The offer will be valid until April 12, 2024 or until the set quota is reached.
This product has a dark side, the Avantio Account. It is free only if you have €10,000 invested in a bank product; in addition to other conditions that are easy to meet.
The entity accepts the €10,000 deposit so that you do not pay commissions on the account. So the problem would come after the expiration. You will have to cancel the account or you will have to pay €75 in semi-annual commissions (€150 per year).
The account is remunerated at 1% APR, but if you additionally direct a payroll, the account will give you 2.53% APR (2.5% TIN) for a maximum of €50,000.
The account supports up to 2 account holders.


Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.
The bank set the marketing deadline for this product until April 12, 2023.
Banca March will continue to offer 12-month deposit terms and 3.3% APR until December 31, 2023.
This deposit, which was scheduled to end its marketing period on October 31, 2023, will be available to savers during the rest of the year."

Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month.
All in all, the demands are:
The bank accepts payroll, pension or recurring income to give you the promotion:

The account is without commissions and without conditions:
This offer is exclusively for new clients of the bank and without the need to direct deposit the payroll or anything. Only if you want the €300 or €400 bonus, you must direct deposit the income and the 2 receipts, and it is valid until April 5, 2024.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Not only is BBVA, which pays more in other countries, up to 4.25% APR for a 12-month deposit in Italy for just opening a commission-free account (see here), Banco Santander is also offering better rates outside from Spain, much better, up to 5% APR or more.

This deposit appears when you try to take the money from the bank by initiating the transfer process to another bank (see below).
If we compare it with what it was giving at the end of 2023, which offered up to 3.5% APR, it is clear that the bank has lost interest in retaining money from its clients or perhaps will continue to do so, without paying anything extra for it. .
In any case, it is better to offer little, than to offer nothing. This exclusive deposit is for the money that is already in the bank and does not require payroll or anything. He just wants you not to take the money to another bank.
According to the pre-contractual document, the offer is valid from February 20, 2024 and there is no expiration date.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""

66,Novum Bank offers 2 deposits at 6 and 12 months and at 3.5 and 3.9% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/novum-bank-ofrece-2-depositos-a-6-y-12-meses-y-al-35-y-39-tae/,23/02/2024,"Novum Bank is offering Spanish savers 2 high-yield deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months and at 3.5% APR and 3.9% APR respectively.
These are bank deposits that can be contracted from €10,000 and up to a maximum of €100,000; always covered by the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD), in this case of Malta.
Novum Bank is an entity based in Malta and has permission to market banking products in Spain.
However, they have not opened a branch here, so your money will be outside our borders, and if you had more than €50,000 you would have to file form 720, in addition to having to declare the interest earned on your own.
Another drawback that we see is that it does not allow early cancellations, so if you invest, you should know that you would not be able to have those funds until maturity.
The characteristics of its deposits are:
The bank does not require creating a bank account or contracting another financial product to contract the deposit.
For more information, you can call any business day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at +34 900525860 or send an email to sudeposito@novumbank.es


All of you who have had more than €50,000 as of December 31, 2023 have to present form 720 and you have until April 1 to do so.
If you do not present it or present it after the deadline, having the obligation, you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency.
Many taxpayers avoid the annual procedure of submitting the income tax return if they are within certain income limits and types of income, because the Treasury considers that adequate withholdings have been applied to these people.
However, if you have had any deposit from the Raisin platform, except Haigton Sucusal in Spain, you will have obtained interest that has NOT been declared to the Spanish Tax Agency, and therefore, you have the obligation to file your income tax return and add said interests obtained abroad.
""Due to the high number of applications received by CA Auto Bank, new applications will temporarily not be accepted,"" is how it appears on the Raisin website dedicated to the products of this entity recently launched via this platform.
In this way, the Auto Bank offer goes on standby in less than 2 weeks after its launch. The truth is that the interest rate offered by this bank was very attractive."

BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR.
In the month of December, BFS stopped short the successive increases in the profitability of its deposits, to make the first decrease in years.
This week the bank deals a hard blow to its fixed terms, eliminating its most profitable deposits, those NOT cancelable, and slightly lowering the others, those that do allow early cancellations."
68,Understanding Tech Company Stock Performance in 2024,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/entendiendo-el-rendimiento-de-las-acciones-de-las-empresas-tecnologicas-en-2024/,23/02/2024,"In 2024, after overcoming a sea of ​​challenges, technology stocks are making a strong comeback, with a significant year-to-date increase. Leaders like Microsoft and Amazon exemplify resilience in the face of rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions. This article will dissect these influences on performance, offering insights into successful investment strategies and what drives growth in this dynamic sector.
You're navigating an investment landscape in 2024 where geopolitical tensions cast a shadow over tech stocks. Look at relations between the US and China: they are fundamental in shaping data policies and the availability of technological pieces, affecting giants listed on exchanges like NASDAQ or Shanghai. However, not everything is gloomy. U.S. initiatives like the Reduce Inflation Act and the CHIPS Act are strengthening economic stability and domestic chip production—think of them as your safety net against market volatility. For astute investors like you, understanding these elements is crucial to making informed decisions that can withstand fluctuations in tech stocks.
In this context, it is important to highlight the increasingly relevant role of cybersecurity in the strategy of technology companies. A notable example is Surfshark, a company specializing in VPN services, which has become an indispensable tool to ensure the security of online data and user privacy. For investors interested in this sector, it is possible to safely download Surfshark and experience first-hand the capabilities of this promising company.
When considering your technology investments for 2024, start by looking at companies like Apple. Its commitment to innovation—think wearables and augmented reality—is backed by a strong ecosystem and unwavering customer loyalty. Nvidia is another giant, leading advances in AI while dominating the GPU space.
But don't just focus on the big ones; Smaller companies like Copart are making waves with their technologically advanced approach to online vehicle auctions.
Innovation is your compass to detect future leaders. Take Gilead Sciences: Its work in biopharmaceuticals could redefine the healthcare sector.
Here's the key: combine proven, cash-rich giants like Apple with rising stars like Copart. This strategy offers you a robust shield against market vagaries while keeping an eye on growth.
As we look ahead to 2024, it's clear that careful stock selection will be key in the technology sector. Expect a return to average performance levels—what analysts call 'reversion to the mean.' This trend underscores the value of your ability to identify strong stocks within an expanding market landscape. Remember, despite the sector's promising growth this year, uncertainty persists due to potential political changes and global economic shifts. Companies with solid business models should be your focus; are poised to eclipse those built on unstable speculative narratives.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun.

We say that it is good news because among the other candidates was Deutsche Bank, with many commissions, or Morgan Stanley, a total unknown.
On the other hand, Cetelem has a commercial strategy very similar to Orange Bank, oriented towards an operational and savings account and consumer loans.
Of course, there are quite a few things we don't like about Celetem, and we fear that they will get worse:
As you can see, Orange Bank's offer is clearly better than the Cetelem Plan, and many will even like it more than the Premium plan as it has no commissions even if it rents a little less.
We will see if BNP finally buys it and what decision it makes about its account, which has more than 200,000 clients.

The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
The interest rate offered by this bank depending on the term is a faithful example of how deposits could evolve in the coming months.
Seeing this panorama, we advise you that perhaps it is time to invest for the long term and with high profitability, for what may come, which will surely be more declines.
You already know that it is very difficult for banks to overpay you, but to underpay you, they react much faster:

It also extends the contracting period until March 27, 2024, products that were launched in May 2023, and since then the rates had not been touched.
As we have pointed out on other occasions, the MyInvestor offer is good, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe that it is is left behind.
Only the 12-month deposit offers the same profitability as the other 2 banks:
During the month of November 2023, MyInvestor raised its savings account from 2% APR to 2.5% APR and for a maximum remuneration that goes from €50,000 to €70,000.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.

MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

This is how Banco BIG has been for a few days with its deposit at 5% APR and now MyInvestor with its deposit at 4% APR.
As you can imagine, that 5% APR is only given if you also invest in another product, and not exactly savings.
It is a 6-month deposit linked to an investment fund: 50% in the deposit, and 50% in the fund.
You already know how this works, right? It puts that 5% APR in large numbers, and the investment fund in small letters.

MyInvestor gives you a deposit at 4% APR and for 3 months if you hire an automated portfolio (roboadvisor) from 150 euros.
It should be prohibited to link a deposit with a high-risk investment product, but it appears to be legal.
This offer will be valid from tomorrow, February 22nd until March 27th.

Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

Thus, we have until March 6, 2024, to contract your 2-year deposit at 3.44% APR, and the savings account at 2.89% APR.
The bank made the first decrease 4 weeks ago, after many months of constant increases (since May 2022), and that affected its deposit, which lost 0.41 percentage points, to the current 3.44% APR.
This cut was greater than we expected, placing it below June 2023.

The characteristics of your 2-year deposit are as follows:

Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.

It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little."

Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR last week, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
In this way, the difference between the online channel and the physical bank has been greatly shortened, and we know that the bank prefers to redirect its clientele to the online channel, because, among other things, the bank has very few offices and rather reserves for remittances from Ecuadorian citizens working in Spain.
Specifically, there are only 12 offices with a presence in only 6 Spanish cities: Alicante, Barcelona, ​​Madrid, Murcia, Valencia and Zaragoza.
The 2 savings products currently offered by the bank are:


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR
Pibank is only the online office of Banco Pichincha. For all intents and purposes it is the same bank, with the peculiarity that you must operate online.
What do you prefer? A few offices or more profitability in your savings products?"

Longer-term deposits, 2, 3 and 5 years, have gone down the drain, only offered at 0.5% APR. Who is going to contract these products? Absolutely nobody.
In this way, the only ones that are somewhat interesting are the first ones, and due to their deadline, they are not very advisable. Too short term for our taste.
The characteristics of BAI Europe deposits are:
The entity is Portuguese, with no office in Spain, so if you request, it will make reduced withholdings of 15% in Portugal, deductible later due to the issue of international double taxation.
You must declare the interest and apply the withholding deductions on your own.
Also, do not exceed €50,000 abroad or you will have to make the 720 model (see here).
Banco BAI Europa S.A. was originally founded in Portugal in 1998 as a branch of BAI, Banco Angolano de Investimentos, an Angolan international bank.
In 2002, it became an independent subsidiary under Portuguese legislation, supervised by the Portuguese Central Bank and the European Union.
Banco Bai Europa, S.A. offers banking products and services for individuals and businesses, and focuses on innovative solutions to support small and medium-sized businesses. The bank is headquartered in Lisbon.


Banco BAI Europa snips the profitability of its deposits and loses the psychological level of 4% APR, now the maximum it offers is 3.8% APR.
The cuts affect the terms of 6 and 12 months, and which were the bank's most profitable.
Banco BAI Europa, a Portuguese entity, which offers deposits through the Raisin platform, is the bank that gives the most profitability at the moment, up to 4.2% APR, surpassing the new Auto Bank offer"

It surpasses Renault Bank (2.89% APR) by almost 1 point or EBN Banco (3% APR for €10,000) and even surpasses the accounts offered by some collaborating banks on the Raisin platform, such as Klarna (3.29% APR) , Distingo (3.20% APR) or CKV (3.14% APR)
It falls behind the Trade Republic account (4% APR), but the latter is not a savings account, but a Cash Account.
The evolution of Norwegian's account has been spectacular, from 0.5% APR, in January, 1.25% APR, in March, 2% APR, in June, 2.5% APR, in November, 2 changes, 3.3% APR and 3.4% APR, in December at 3.5% APR, and now at 3.7% APR.
3.7% APR, liquid money, is a great deal; But lately we must look at the long terms, lately we are seeing many rate cuts.
This account is a Savings Account in the style of the ING Orange Account. You will not have any additional services.
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The account characteristics are:
The money is guaranteed by Sweden's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.
At the beginning of February, in your Client Area, the entity will provide you with the annual declaration of your account for what you take into account in the income tax return.
By not opening a branch in Spain:
In any case, making the 720 model is not complicated as we tell you here, and declaring the interest is not that big of a deal either.

77,Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR for all customers. Worth?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuenta-ahorro-de-wizink-al-23-tae-para-todos-los-clientes-merece-la-pena/,16/02/2024,"The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?
We have always criticized the operation of this bank. We have been clients of the bank for years and for the successive deposits that we have contracted, it has created an account for each of them, and ALL are now remunerated at 1% APR instead of the 2.3% APR that it offers to new hires .
But hey, it's not a big problem, because if we want the 2.3% APR we just have to sign up for a new account, but it is a hassle as you can imagine.
Some clients have been lucky, and already have the Savings Account at 2.3% APR, and it is because they contracted it independently, without being linked to a deposit. What sense does this have? None, in our opinion.
The characteristics of this product are as follows:
The truth is that currently only 2 banks exceed Wizink's profitability. We are talking about an account with the same conditions as Wizink, without requirements and a branch in Spain:
You also have Norweigan Bank that gives its account at 3.7% APR, the but is that it does not have a branch in Spain. You may have to file form 720 and declare foreign interests.
And the most profitable, Trade Republic which gives 4% APR, but it is not a checking account, but a securities account.
Could we add MyInvestor at 2.5% APR? We think not, since it is only for new clients and for 1 year and then requires links.
There are other banks that give almost the same:
So? As you can see, few surpass Wizink's new offer, so YES, it is interesting, but only for the money that you want to have liquid.
But if you have savings and want to make it profitable for a while, it is better to choose a deposit with a 1 or 2 year term.
The current trend is downward, at any time, these accounts may suffer a drop, however, if you contract a deposit, you ensure that profitability for the entire contracted term.
Currently, there are quite a few deposits between 3% APR and 4% APR, especially on the Raisin savings platform:
What are you left with? Leave us your choice/opinion below.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
If you have a Savings Account opened in Wizink without it being linked to a deposit, starting tomorrow, February 15, it will be remunerated at 2.3% APR, the same as the bank gives for a 25-month deposit. term.
Accounts that were contracted by opening a deposit will also increase, but only up to 1% APR, as we indicated yesterday."
78,"EBN Banco puts all its deposits at 3.1% APR, you just have to choose the term",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-banco-pone-todos-su-depositos-al-31-tae-solo-has-de-elegir-plazo/,15/02/2024,"EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
These products will be in force until March 1, 2024 and the characteristics are as follows:
EBN, since October 1, 2023, offers its Remunerated Account at 3% APR and for all clients. Too bad it's only for the first €10,000:
The characteristics of your account are:
NOTE: If you put, for example, €60,000 in the bank: the first €10,000 is remunerated at 3% APR; The next €40,000 is remunerated at 1.5% APR and the rest (€10,000 is not remunerated).
This account is without commissions, without demands. It is a savings account so it does not accept direct debits, debits, or payment operations using credit or debit cards.



EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here).
EBN bank increases the profitability of several of its deposits for Black Friday, which will last between November 16 and 27.
This extra profitability, of up to 3.6% APR, affects fixed terms of 4, 12 and 24 months and will be very close to the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big ( see here)."
79,Immediate transfers will cost the same as normal transfers,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/las-transferencias-inmediatas-costara-lo-mismo-que-las-normales/,15/02/2024,"Yesterday, February 14, the European Parliament adopted new rules to ensure that bank transfers reach the accounts of individuals and companies in the EU immediately.
The most significant thing for clients is that banks cannot charge higher than normal transfers.
Currently, many banks, such as Openbank (among others) and, offer their customers free normal transfers, but charge for immediate transfers. Since the entry into force of the new rule, this will no longer be possible.
The bank can make 2 decisions:
The new standard has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union on February 14, 2024, and will begin to be applied in 20 days.
EU banking entities and payment services have up to 9 months to prepare their systems for the instant transfer and up to 18 months for these to be carried out.
>> Consult the original text of the standard
Most banks have immediate transfers, but few offer it for free:
The most expensive without a doubt and by far is Bankinter.
If you have 2 mobile numbers, you can transfer between your 2 bank accounts immediately using Bizum.
Logically, it has limitations that have been set by each bank and by Bizum, but you can move money instantly between your accounts.
>> See more detail here
It is said that ""in the absence of bread, cakes are good."" Well, there are banks that do not offer immediate transfers, but in exchange, they offer their clients same-day transfers.
BONUS: Get immediate transfers between ""any"" bank using Bizum.
Pibank's immediate transfers are now available to its clients again, after 3 weeks out of service for maintenance tasks.
Bankinter charges €12 commission for a simple immediate transfer, oh, and €10 for a same-day transfer. The most expensive without a doubt of all the banks.
Not even the payroll exempts from these neon commissions."
80,New extension of the Online Account at 6% APR for 3 months from Sabadell,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/nueva-prorroga-de-la-cuenta-online-al-6-tae-durante-3-meses-del-sabadell/,15/02/2024,"Banco de Sabadell has once again extended the contracting of its Online Account without commissions and remunerated at 6% TIN during the first 3 months if you are a new customer of the bank.
This time, the new deadline given by the bank is until February 29, 2 more weeks, and it is the third extension by the bank. The first time, on January 2, for almost 1 month, then on January 30, for 15 more days and now for another 15.
As we say, this high profitability can only be enjoyed by the bank's new clients during the initial period of 3 months. Former customers or once the bonus period has ended, the account will have a 2% APR.
The bank limits the amount paid to the first €20,000 both during the bonus period and afterwards.
In this way, the real bonus for new clients is €200 of extra profitability at most. Obtaining during the 3 months for €20,000, €300 gross in interest, instead of €100.
The account characteristics are:
This offer will only be valid until February 29, 2024.
You would get that APR if you leave the money throughout the year:
The 3.039% APR would be the average APR of an investment of your money in said account for 1 full year. But you have no obligation to leave the money throughout the year.
You can take advantage of only the first 3 months (6% TIN) and take it to another bank later. The average APR you get in 1 year will depend on where you put the money for the rest of the 9 months. But for those 3 months in Sabadell, you get a 6% TIN (a little more than 6% APR when you have monthly interest payments: 6.16% APR).


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
81,BFS cuts the profitability of its deposits a little more,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-recorta-un-poco-mas-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos/,14/02/2024,"BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR.
The interest rate offered by this bank depending on the term is a faithful example of how deposits could evolve in the coming months.
Seeing this panorama, we advise you that perhaps it is time to invest for the long term and with high profitability, for what may come, which will surely be more declines.
You already know that it is very difficult for banks to overpay you, but to underpay you, they react much faster:
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The deposits offered are valid until February 18, 2024.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
In the month of December, BFS stopped short the successive increases in the profitability of its deposits, to make the first decrease in years.
This week the bank deals a hard blow to its fixed terms, eliminating its most profitable deposits, those NOT cancelable, and slightly lowering the others, those that do allow early cancellations."
82,Wizink will give accounts NOT linked to deposits at 2.3% APR starting tomorrow,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/wizink-dara-a-partir-de-manana-al-23-tae-las-cuentas-no-vinculadas-a-depositos/,14/02/2024,"If you have a Savings Account opened in Wizink without it being linked to a deposit, starting tomorrow, February 15, it will be remunerated at 2.3% APR, the same as the bank gives for a 25-month deposit. term.
Accounts that were contracted by opening a deposit will also increase, but only up to 1% APR, as we indicated yesterday.
In this sense, the bank has communicated to its clients, and leaves us wondering if the bank will allow new openings of the Savings Account at 2.3% APR.
If it were affirmative, it would not make any sense to have these 2 accounts with such a difference in profitability. If anyone would be interested, they will open a new account to get 2.3% APR instead of 1% APR.
In fact, even if this were not the case, this discrimination is too great just because of how you contracted the account. Can someone explain to us what the meaning of these 2 accounts is? Any commercial/strategic advantages for the bank?

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.

ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

87,Another snip from Haitong on its deposits up to 3.7% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/otro-tijeretazo-de-haitong-sobre-sus-depositos-hasta-el-37-tae/,09/02/2024,"Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting.
Haitong is a Portuguese entity (Portuguese FGD), which markets its products via the Raisin platform, but unlike the rest of the banks, it has a branch in Spain, which gives it a great advantage.
Taking out a deposit in Haitong is as if you were doing it at ING or Orange Bank. You will have personal income tax withholdings and your data will be communicated to the Tax Agency like any other Spanish bank.
Another issue is whether or not you trust the bank. Haitong is the former Banco Espirito Santo that was acquired by the Chinese group Haitong Securities and which now markets deposits through Raisin.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.

The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Finally, Haitong Bank has cut the profitability of absolutely all its deposits, in addition to the 1-year term announced by Raisin.
With this reduction, the bank loses the 4% APR level that it had been offering for months. Specifically, since July 2023.
Now the maximum that the bank offers is 3.95% APR for a 1-year term and 3.78% APR for a 2-year term, which are also the most interesting due to the downward trend in rates."
88,Deutsche Bank offers you €360 per payroll and/or 2% APR for 1 year in your More DB account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/deutsche-bank-te-ofrece-en-su-cuenta-mas-db-360e-por-nomina-y-o-2-tae-1-ano/,08/02/2024,"Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.
In addition, the account has many advantages:
And now comes the catch, you must meet one of the following 2 conditions:
It also entails requirements to benefit from the €360 and/or 2% APR:
The bank will pay you €30 net per month for 12 months if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or SEPE benefit of at least €2,000 per month.
Keep in mind that the bank offers bonuses for the first 12 months from the opening of the account, so you must direct your payroll from the beginning if you want to receive the entire €360.
The €30, as we indicated, are net, since the bank is in charge of depositing the corresponding withholdings into the Tax Agency without affecting the client.
You are given this 2% APR return, as long as you have €50,000 or more in the account, and up to a maximum of €500,000.
The account balance is checked daily and must be at least €50,000.

Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Today we echo an email received that denounced ""what is hidden in the conditions of the current promotion of the Deutsche Bank More DB Account.""
Deutsche Bank launches an offer to capture payroll, of at least €2,000 per month, with a bonus of €360 and a return of 2% APR on the account.
As we can see, it tries to capture large payrolls, and for large capitals, because it requires keeping at least €50,000 in the account to give you that 2% APR."
89,"Orange Bank España could be owned by BNP, Deutsche Bank or Morgan Stanley",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-espana-podria-ser-de-bnp-deutsche-bank-o-morgan-stanley/,07/02/2024,"In June 2023, Orange Bank began exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas for its sale, but in November the bank decided to sell its business in Spain separately.
Today we learned that BNP, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are the entities that could take over Orange Bank's business.
The loan business of this entity is especially interesting for them, which has a balance of 680 million euros pending payment from more than 1 million customers who requested to finance the purchase of a mobile phone.
The competitive process that began in November, and which was scheduled to close in mid-February, is running late. There are no binding offers yet.
If you are an Orange Bank customer, you don't have to worry. Orange Bank is NOT closing, or going bankrupt, or anything like that.
What happens is that Orange, the company on which it depends, no longer wants to continue in the retail banking adventure and is going to sell it.
For many, it is even good news, because Orange scares many many people. The bad thing is the uncertainty of the new commercial strategy that the entity that acquires Orange Bank will apply.
Loan customers need not worry, their contract is binding and cannot be modified, regardless of who the new owner is.
On the other hand, savings account/card clients may undergo changes, but these will come progressively, and as things change, we can decide what to do.
Among the 3 options, we believe that the best would be BNP. What do you think? Leave us a comment below.
We do not know if Orange Bank's banking file will be preserved or eliminated and the entity that buys the bank will be absorbed.
This decision may affect the FGD:
We have experienced a few restructurings:
We can see that in all cases, clients lose out over time, and possibly, the same could happen with Orange Bank.
There is only one exception, Evo Banco which offers a decent account (no commissions and no conditions) and an acceptable deposit (2.5% APR for 12 months).
What do you think will happen with Orange Bank? Leave us a comment below.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

The bank only extends its products for 2 more weeks, until February 20, leaving its deposit with a 2-year term at 3.44% APR, and the savings account at 2.89% APR.
2 weeks ago, the bank made the first decrease after many months of constant increases (since May 2022), and that affected its deposit, which lost 0.41 percentage points.
This cut was greater than we expected, placing it below June 2023.

The characteristics of your 2-year deposit are as follows:
Offer valid until February 20, 2024.
The entity still does not touch, for the moment, the profitability of its Savings Account, which is at 2.89% APR, the interest rate set in the month of November 2023.

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
It is a very similar offer to the Evo Banco Smart Account savings account, but it is a deposit with a fixed term and without the hassle of whether or not you have to put €4,000 in the current account.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco.
The offer is valid until April 30, 2024.
To new customers who sign up for the Smart Account, the bank offers a return of 2.85% APR until January 31, 2025.
This is an extra bonus for at least 1 year, but limits this profitability to a maximum of €30,000. In addition, you must have €4,000 in the unpaid account.
The Smart account is about 2 linked accounts:
What the bank does is that on the 15th of each month, it checks the balance of the unpaid account. All balances exceeding €4,000 will be transferred to the term account at 2.85% APR for a period of 4 months, automatically renewable and with full availability without commissions.
The rest of the features are:

Evo Banco remunerates the Smart Account of the bank's clients with 1.1% APR, as long as you meet 1 of the following 3 requirements:
Otherwise, the account is remunerated at 0.7% APR.
It is the bank's strong point, allowing free debit withdrawals from more than 16,000 ATMs with no minimum amount and no withdrawal limit:
You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €200.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.

92,Money in Raisin in 2023? Obliged to make the declaration even if you were exempt,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/dinero-en-raisin-en-2023-obligado-a-hacer-la-declaracion-aunque-estuvieras-exento/,05/02/2024,"Many taxpayers avoid the annual procedure of submitting the income tax return if they are within certain income limits and types of income, because the Treasury considers that adequate withholdings have been applied to these people.
However, if you have had any deposits from the Raisin platform, except for Haigton Sucusal in Spain, you will have obtained interests that have NOT been declared to the Spanish Tax Agency, and therefore, you have the obligation to file your income tax return and add said interests obtained abroad.
Logically, the same will happen if you have had other deposits in foreign banks contracted outside of the Raisin platform.
If you do not comply with this obligation, you will have a double penalty:
You must add it in the “Interest on accounts, deposits and financial assets” section, in previous years, in boxes 027.
What we have to do is add the interest obtained in Spain to the gross interest obtained abroad in the Complete Income box and nothing in withholdings and expenses.

If you have withheld withholdings in a foreign bank, and it is in a country with an agreement with Spain to avoid international double taxation (Not in countries considered tax havens), you can deduct it.
Ideally, when opening an account abroad, you should indicate to the bank in question that you are not a resident of that country so that they DO NOT apply any withholding tax to you.
But if not, you CANNOT add it in the withholding box, but rather you must put it as deductions for International Double Taxation (Box 588):

The lower of the following 2 values ​​may be deducted:
RentaWeb will calculate this value automatically, generally, the deduction will be 19% (generally) if the tax rate abroad is higher than that of Spain, and otherwise, the taxes paid abroad.
To know whether or not a person is exempt from making the Declaration, his or her sources of income must be taken into account, since there are limits that must not be exceeded. These limits are identical for individual and joint taxation.
People who have only obtained income from the following sources are exempt from personal income tax and, therefore, are not required to submit an Income Tax Return now in 2024:
1. WORK PERFORMANCE
1.- Taxpayers who have obtained income from work up to the limit of €22,000 per year will not have to declare when they come from a single payer.
Or if the taxpayer had income from more than one payer, without exceeding the limit of €22,000 and was in one of the following two situations:
a).- That the sum of the amounts received from the second and remaining payers does not exceed a total of €1,500 per year.
b).- That their only income from work consists of the passive benefits referred to in article 17.2.a) of the Tax Law.
2.- The income limit is €15,000 in the following cases:
2. PERFORMANCE ON MOVABLE CAPITAL
Full income from movable capital and capital gains as long as they have been subject to withholding with a limit of €1,600 per year.
3. IMPUTED REAL ESTATE INCOME
Full income from movable capital not subject to withholding derived from Treasury bills and subsidies for the acquisition of official protection or appraised price, with a joint limit of €1,000 per year.
All of you who have had more than €50,000 as of December 31, 2023 have to present form 720 and you have until April 1 to do so.
If you do not present it or present it after the deadline, having the obligation, you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency.

These rates have been lowered today and now the maximum offered when it reopens to new applications will be 4% APR for 6 months, the only one that has not been cut, and the rest of the terms no longer reach 4 % APR:

Furthermore, just by having the money abroad and obtaining interest without withholding in Spain, you are required to file your income tax return annually.
Crédit Agricole Auto Bank belongs to the Crédit Agricole group, the tenth banking group in the world and the leader in Europe in terms of number of clients.
With operations in 19 European countries, Crédit Agricole Auto Bank is positioned as one of the leading providers of vehicle financing, leasing and mobility services.
Founded in 1925, the bank has almost a century of experience in the European automobile industry.
It offers a wide variety of financial, rental and insurance services in collaboration with more than 50 brands.


The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR).
CA Auto Bank, which suspended the contracting of its deposits at the beginning of February due to the ""high number of requests"", reactivates the contracting of its deposits, but at a significantly lower profitability.
That 4.12% APR that it offered at its launch in January 2024 quickly disappeared. Now, at most, the bank offers a 2-year deposit and a 3.34% APR, which we do not believe will saturate the entity with requests again.
Crédit Agricole Auto Bank, the subsidiary of Crédit Agricole, has opened a branch in Spain and begins to offer high-profit deposits. Up to 4.2% APR.
The terms range from 6 months with a 4% APR, passed through 1 (4.1% APR), 2 (the most profitable at 4.2% APR), 3 (4.1% APR), 4 (4% APR) and a maximum of 5 years (3.90% APR)."

A little over 1 week ago, when we published our first post about this bank's products, we indicated that they were the most profitable on the Raisin platform. Well, with this change, it is no longer so.
It is now clearly surpassed by Auto Bank, which has also cut the interest rate on its deposits, but not by as much. It offers up to 4.12% APR, above the aforementioned psychological mark.
BAI Europe's fixed terms range from 6 months to 5 years and shorter terms (6 and 12 months) continue to be more profitable:
NOTE: Auto Bank is currently not allowing new hires due to strong demand for applications.
The characteristics of BAI Europe deposits are:
The entity is Portuguese, with no office in Spain, so if you request, it will make reduced withholdings of 15% in Portugal, deductible later due to the issue of international double taxation.
You must declare the interest and apply the withholding deductions on your own.
Also, do not exceed €50,000 abroad or you will have to make the 720 model (see here).
Banco BAI Europa S.A. was originally founded in Portugal in 1998 as a branch of BAI, Banco Angolano de Investimentos, an Angolan international bank.

Banco Bai Europa, S.A. offers banking products and services for individuals and businesses, and focuses on innovative solutions to support small and medium-sized businesses. The bank is headquartered in Lisbon.


BAI Europe entered our bay on January 25 with deposits of up to 4.2% APR, the most profitable at that time, in less than 1 month, it has fallen to 3.6% APR and only 6 and 12 months term.
Longer-term deposits, 2, 3 and 5 years, have gone down the drain, only offered at 0.5% APR. Who is going to contract these products? Absolutely nobody.

Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.

This product was launched at the beginning of September and only for that month, but it has already been extended several times, although this latest extension is the shortest time, less than 2 weeks.
It is an offer that attracts many savers, but it is not a big deal if we compare it with entities like Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here) that offer a 3.75% APR for 3 months without asking you for anything in return.
However, ING is still the favorite of many clients, which we do not understand very well (see here), but it is their choice.
The characteristics of this product are:
Today the new interest rate for the Orange Account comes into effect, which will pay up to 1.5% APR if you also have the Payroll Account:
In mid-January, ING cut the interest rate on all these products, except the 6-month term.
The maximum return it gave was 3% APR, and it has been lowered to 2.85% APR for terms of 12 and 18 months and for investments of at least €100,000.
You can access their deposits from €1, however, the profitability will be lower:
The rest of the characteristics of this deposit are:


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

We already warned of this shameful mistreatment of Spanish clients by Spanish banks in general by Spanish banks, and specifically by BBVA in the month of November (see here).
Furthermore, BBVA does not even allow Spanish clients to contract these products with the Italian subsidiary, since they not only request an Italian telephone number, an Italian NIF, etc., but also ask that you be a resident of that country.
«OCU has filed a complaint with the Customer Ombudsman of the aforementioned entity, as well as with the Bank of Spain to take action on the matter, putting a stop to these discriminatory practices that not only call into question the free movement of capital of the European Union, but they discriminate against Spanish users.

Here it only offers an online account without commissions and without remuneration for new clients.
It also offers a 13-month deposit, but you need to invest at the same time in an investment fund (minimum 30% in fund), in exchange the bank rewards the deposit with an ""extraordinary"" 0.65% APR.

BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.

Specifically, all the deposits offered by this bank are:
The characteristics of these fixed terms are:
These fixed terms slightly exceed Haitong Bank, another entity that offers deposits in Raisin, in some terms:
We believe that Haitong Bank is better, because BluOr Bank has some disadvantages compared to the first, by NOT having a branch in Spain:


BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
BlueOrange Bank also increases the profitability of its deposits, in this way, there are already 3 banks (Wizink and Facto) that have applied an increase in the profitability of their products in the month of April.
BlueOrange Bank is a Latvian entity that offers its deposits through Raisn, which are now remunerated up to 1.16% APR.
BlueOrange Bank, a Latvian entity, offers deposits through Raisn, raising its 12-month deposit to 1.22% APR.
The increase is very slight, from 1.15% APR to 1.22% APR, just enough to surpass Haitong's 1.17% APR and become the most profitable 1-year deposit offered through this platform."

It is the second time that the bank has extended this offer, the first time, on January 2, 2024, for almost 1 month and now for another 15 days.
As we say, this high profitability can only be enjoyed by the bank's new clients during the initial period of 3 months. Former customers or once the bonus period has ended, the account will have a 2% APR.
The bank limits the amount paid to the first €20,000 both during the bonus period and afterwards.
In this way, the real bonus for new clients is €200 of extra profitability at most. Obtaining during the 3 months for €20,000, €300 gross in interest, instead of €100.
The account characteristics are:
This offer will only be valid until February 14, 2024.
You would get that APR if you leave the money throughout the year:
The 3.039% APR would be the average APR of an investment of your money in said account for 1 full year. But you have no obligation to leave the money throughout the year.
You can take advantage of only the first 3 months (6% TIN) and take it to another bank later. The average APR you get in 1 year will depend on where you put the money for the rest of the 9 months. But for those 3 months in Sabadell, you get a 6% TIN (a little more than 6% APR when you have monthly interest payments: 6.16% APR).

After its last snip in the month of October, its products were no longer of great interest to the majority of savers, since it offered a maximum of 2.5% APR.
It is too low a profitability if we were to buy it with other entities that easily exceed 3% APR: Haitong (3.95% APR), Facto (3.75% APR), BFS (3.45% APR) or Pibank (3. 34% APR).
Wizink's new offer is:
The characteristics of the products, subject to changes, are:
This offer will be valid until February 29, 2024.
The savings account continues at 1% APR, but it only applies to recently contracted accounts, the old ones that were at 0.5% APR remain unchanged:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

BAI Europe offers deposits from 6 months to 5 years like Auto Bank, but focuses more on shorter terms (6 and 12 months), where it offers more profitability (4.2% APR).
However, at longer terms, the profitability is not as good, below 3.5% APR. On the other hand, Auto Bank offers more than 4.1% APR for 2 and 3 years.
The characteristics of BAI Europe deposits are:
The entity is Portuguese, with no office in Spain, so if you request, it will make reduced withholdings of 15% in Portugal, deductible later due to the issue of international double taxation.
You must declare the interest and apply the withholding deductions on your own.
Also, do not exceed €50,000 abroad or you will have to make the 720 model (see here).
Banco BAI Europa S.A. was originally founded in Portugal in 1998 as a branch of BAI, Banco Angolano de Investimentos, an Angolan international bank.
In 2002, it became an independent subsidiary under Portuguese legislation, supervised by the Portuguese Central Bank and the European Union.
Banco Bai Europa, S.A. offers banking products and services for individuals and businesses, and focuses on innovative solutions to support small and medium-sized businesses. The bank is headquartered in Lisbon.


BAI Europe entered our bay on January 25 with deposits of up to 4.2% APR, the most profitable at that time, in less than 1 month, it has fallen to 3.6% APR and only 6 and 12 months term.
Longer-term deposits, 2, 3 and 5 years, have gone down the drain, only offered at 0.5% APR. Who is going to contract these products? Absolutely nobody.
Banco BAI Europa snips the profitability of its deposits and loses the psychological level of 4% APR, now the maximum it offers is 3.8% APR.
The cuts affect the terms of 6 and 12 months, and which were the bank's most profitable."

The terms range from 6 months with a 4% APR, passed through 1 (4.1% APR), 2 (the most profitable at 4.2% APR), 3 (4.1% APR), 4 (4% APR) and a maximum of 5 years (3.90% APR).

Founded in 1925, the bank has almost a century of experience in the European automobile industry.
It offers a wide variety of financial, rental and insurance services in collaboration with more than 50 brands.


The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR).
CA Auto Bank, which suspended the contracting of its deposits at the beginning of February due to the ""high number of requests"", reactivates the contracting of its deposits, but at a significantly lower profitability.
That 4.12% APR that it offered at its launch in January 2024 quickly disappeared. Now, at most, the bank offers a 2-year deposit and a 3.34% APR, which we do not believe will saturate the entity with requests again.
""Due to the high number of applications received by CA Auto Bank, new applications will temporarily not be accepted,"" is how it appears on the Raisin website dedicated to the products of this entity recently launched via this platform.
In this way, the Auto Bank offer goes on standby in less than 2 weeks after its launch. The truth is that the interest rate offered by this bank was very attractive."

Banco Caminos, also BancoFar, tries to attract new money by offering a 12-month deposit at a 3.29% APR.
It is a deposit with a not very long term and has the advantage that it is cancelable, although the interest rate is not one of the highest on the market (up to 4% APR), but 3.29% APR is Pretty decent, especially for the bank's existing customers.
Banco Camino rewards more profitability if you deposit more money. How things have changed compared to 1 year ago, when they wanted to charge us for lending them our money!
The entity offers a base profitability of 1.5% APR for all deposits up to €100,000, but if you put more, up to €200,000 it gives you 1.7% APR, and if you put even more, the bank gives you a 1, 81% APR.

Now the maximum that the bank offers is 3.95% APR for a 1-year term and 3.78% APR for a 2-year term, which, along with the 1-year term, are the most interesting due to the downward trend in The types.
Haitong is a Portuguese entity (Portuguese FGD), which markets its products via the Raisin platform, but unlike the rest of the banks, it has a branch in Spain, which gives it a great advantage.
Taking out a deposit in Haitong is as if you were doing it at ING or Orange Bank. You will have personal income tax withholdings and your data will be communicated to the Tax Agency like any other Spanish bank.
Another issue is whether or not you trust the bank. Haitong is the former Banco Espirito Santo that was acquired by the Chinese group Haitong Securities and which now markets deposits through Raisin.

If you left the money for 1 whole year, you would receive €600 in interest; €200 initial bonus for the first 3 months, and €400 in normal interest for the 12 months.

The 3.039% APR would be the average APR of an investment of your money in said account for 1 full year. But you have no obligation to leave the money throughout the year.
You can take advantage of only the first 3 months (6% TIN) and take it to another bank later. The average APR you get in 1 year will depend on where you put the money for the rest of the 9 months. But for those 3 months in Sabadell, you get a 6% TIN (a little more than 6% APR when you have monthly interest payments: 6.16% APR).
This offer will only be valid until January 29, 2024.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

These products were launched in the month of November, whose profitability depends on the amount of your investment, without requiring you to be a new customer or bring new money to the bank.
The entity has cut the interest rate of all these products, except for the 6-month term.
The maximum return it gave was 3% APR, and it has been lowered to 2.85% APR for terms of 12 and 18 months and for investments of at least €100,000.
You can access their deposits from €1, however, the profitability will be lower:
The rest of the characteristics of this deposit are:
As we have recently commented (see here), ING offers a deposit of up to 3.1% APR for 6 months if you threaten to transfer your money to another bank.
In any case, we believe that ING's offer is not that good, there are banks that offer better deposits such as Renault Bank or Cuenta Facto.
If you are a new customer or if you bring new money to the bank, the entity offers you a 4-month deposit at 2.75% APR:
This offer will be available until December 31, 2023.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

This time it will affect your 1-year deposit, which will lose the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR. It will mean a reduction of 0.15 percentage points.
If you are in the process of opening a deposit, you must complete any submission of documentation required by the bank and that the funds you wish to invest are in your Raisin Account before Monday.
If you do not do so, the deposit will be formalized at the new interest rate of 3.95% TIN.
Haitong is a Portuguese entity (Portuguese FGD), which markets its products via the Raisin platform, but unlike the rest of the banks, it has a branch in Spain, which gives it a great advantage.
Taking out a deposit in Haitong is as if you were doing it at ING or Orange Bank. You will have personal income tax withholdings and your data will be communicated to the Tax Agency like any other Spanish bank.
Another issue is whether or not you trust the bank. Haitong is the former Banco Espirito Santo that was acquired by the Chinese group Haitong Securities and which now markets deposits through Raisin.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank. But the 6 and 9 month terms are not long enough to require a cancellation.

The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."
113,Interesting investment alternatives to consider in 2024,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/alternativas-interesantes-de-inversion-para-considerar-en-este-2024/,19/01/2024,"During the first months of the year, savers and investors usually consider different financial instruments in order to improve their personal accounts and start what is to come on the right foot. In that sense, in the following article we have considered some more than interesting alternatives to take into account for our investment portfolio. Which one do you think can give better results throughout 2024? Let's get started.
Without any doubt, the financial world has evolved greatly in recent years thanks to new technologies. The possibility of operating with Tesla stocks or cryptocurrencies, among other instruments, seemed unthinkable for millions of people and today it is within reach. In that sense, the beginning of the year offers a large number of possibilities when it comes to putting together an investment portfolio.
That is why, below, we have compiled some alternatives that we believe can be profitable for this year, resulting in above-average benefits and returns. Which do you consider the most promising? Which one do you think should have been included in the list of this article?
1 – Shares of technology companies: as we mentioned at the beginning with the case of Tesla, the shares of the Stock Market of tech firms are the most coveted today. Tesla, Google, Microsoft or Apple are just some of the most notable examples for 2024.
The truth is that, taking into account the advances that are taking place in research related to Artificial Intelligence, the technological world is experiencing times of enormous change and it is the most important firms that want to take the lead in this transformation. Without a doubt, a great alternative to invest during this year.
2 – Alternative cryptocurrencies: in recent times, the digital currency market has moved with great tenacity. In that sense, the sector has stopped depending solely on the two best-known cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to give rise to a much greater variety.
Along the same lines, growth during 2024 was underpinned by alternative cryptocurrencies, which achieved very significant numbers. It is a reality that, when looking for profits, the youngest have left bank rates behind to venture into the world of cryptocurrencies.
3 – Renewable energies: just as we have highlighted the changes that are being experienced around AI in the tech sector, we must also highlight the movement in the energy sector, where concern for the environment is becoming increasingly stronger both in the field public as well as private.
It is for this reason that many companies concerned about renewable energy and environmental impact have managed to achieve a great appreciation of their shares on the stock market, attracting the attention of locals and strangers. Without a doubt, an investment that can bear great fruit both for our personal accounts and for the planet.
4 – Forex Market: Finally, international currencies are in full swing following the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of the war in Ukraine. Stable values ​​seem like things of the past and it is possible to find important market opportunities this year.
The most important case occurs in the EUR/USD currency pair, which has not achieved a reference point for more than 2 years, with large variations in a short time. The movements of central banks and interest rates will not stop throughout 2024.
Today the CNMV and the Bank of Spain have issued a joint statement on “cryptocurrencies” and “initial cryptocurrency offerings” (ICOs) in which they warn about the danger of investing in these products."
114,ING even offers a 3.1% APR if you fake a transfer,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ing-ofrece-incluso-un-31-tae-si-amagas-una-transferencia/,18/01/2024,"2 days ago we made public an offer that ING gave to certain customers if they started the process of transferring their money from ING to another bank.
It was a 6-month deposit at 3% APR, which, unlike the general offer, does not require an investment of €100,000 or more.
We also asked you to prove if you are a customer and had money in the bank. The feedback received is diverse:
And the offer has not been the same for everyone:

We don't know what strategy ING has followed, but it has always done things like this.
The detailed characteristics, as they have indicated to us, are:
This offer surpasses that offered to new clients or customers who bring new money to the bank and eliminates the requirement to invest €100,000 from the other general offer deposits (see below).
WE REPEAT: we know of the existence of this deposit from the information sent by our users. It is not an offer for everyone, nor do we know the bank's criteria for offering this product.
ING has deposits at 3% APR generally for 12 and 18 months: it does not ask for new money, nor new clients, nor tricks such as threatening to take money from the bank.
Of course, it requires large investments, €100,000 or more. Unfortunately, this is an amount that is not within the reach of all savers, so many who would be interested are left out.
The rest of the characteristics of this deposit are:
Offer valid until January 31, 2024.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
115,"New range of Openbank deposits: with payroll, new money and for everyone",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/nueva-gama-de-depositos-de-openbank-con-nomina-dinero-nuevo-y-para-todos/,17/01/2024,"Openbank has launched a new range of deposits with different objectives: to capture regular income, to capture liquidity or for clients who already have their money in the bank.
Until now, the bank only offered a 6-month deposit to raise new money and with different returns depending on whether you direct deposit any income into the bank (3.07% APR) or not (2.01% APR).
Also another 12-month term for money from other banks and if you direct debit a payroll it gives you 3.05% APR and without a payroll, 2% APR.
Additionally, it has launched 4 fixed terms, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months, for all clients and without the need for new money, with returns from 1.25% APR to 2.44% APR.
They are not great offers, but for those people who are reluctant to change banks and want to stay with Openbank, they now have more offers to choose from.
In summary:
The rest of the characteristics of the deposits are:
Income is considered to be a payroll, pension, unemployment benefit or monthly income of at least €600 per month for at least 4 months for the 6-month deposit, and at least 10 months for the 12-month deposit.
The new money is the increase in the balance of your global position that you had in Openbank as of November 30, 2023.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
116,Now with the feint trick at ING it gives you 3% APR for 6 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ahora-con-el-truco-de-amago-en-ing-te-da-un-3-tae-a-6-meses/,16/01/2024,"According to what several users of our website have told us, the feint trick works again in ING. The counteroffer so that you don't take money from the bank is a deposit at 3% APR and a 6-month term.
This product was already offered in the month of July and later in the month of October, so it was a 12-month term. Now it apparently works again, but only offering 6 months.
Please, if you are an ING customer and have money in the bank, try to start a process of transferring your money to another entity and tell us in the comments below if it offers you anything. The offer goes out before you confirm the transfer.
We have tried with different amounts (up to €6,000) and it has not offered us anything.
The detailed characteristics, as they have indicated to us, are:
This offer beats the one offered to new customers or customers who bring new money to the bank.
WE REPEAT: we know of the existence of this deposit from the information sent by our users. We do not know if it is an offer for everyone, nor do we know the bank's criteria for offering this product. Of course, try it, nothing is lost, and tell us in the comments.
Offer valid until January 31, 2024.

117,Renault Bank cuts its deposit from 3.85% APR to 3.44% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-recorta-su-deposito-desde-el-385-tae-hasta-el-344-tae/,16/01/2024,"Partly expected, and partly we did not want to see it, according to the survey launched a few days ago, but Renault Bank has cut the profitability of its 2-year deposit from 3.85% APR to 3.44% APR.
46% of the votes received thought that it would extend its products without changes, and 41% thought that it would cut it, finally, the latter are right.
The cut has been 0.41 percentage points, almost half a point, to 3.44% APR, a profitability that falls very short if we compare it with the offer of Haitong Bank or Banca Sistema de Raisin, which give around 4% APR for that same term.
The entity had been uploading its products non-stop since May 2022. In recent months, we were seeing a maximum being reached, and today we confirmed the change in trend.
In addition, the cut is greater than we expected, placing it below June 2023. As we always say, it is difficult for banks to pay you more, but to lower you, they hurry.
The next stop, on February 6, 2024. On the 7th, will there be a new cut? We'll see.

The characteristics of your 2-year deposit are as follows:
Offer valid until February 6, 2024.
The entity has not touched, for the moment, the profitability of its Savings Account, which remains at 2.89% APR, the interest rate set in the month of November 2023.

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.

118,Pibank will lower the profitability of your deposit to 3.1% APR on Valentine's Day,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/pibank-bajara-la-rentabilidad-de-su-deposito-hasta-el-31-tae-en-san-valentin/,15/01/2024,"Pibank is informing its clients that starting February 14 it will reduce their 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR.
It will be a slight cut (0.24 percentage points) after 7 months without changes and breaks a bullish streak that dates back to April 2022 (see here).
By saying it so far in advance, almost 1 month, both new customers and existing customers can take advantage of the current offer.
A 12-month deposit at 3.34% APR is quite interesting, but if you can, opt for 2-year deposits. The offer from Renault Bank (3.85% APR for 2 years), among others, seems much more interesting to us. Everything indicates that there will be more and more declines.
The characteristics of this product will be:
Pibank has not yet communicated anything about its Savings Account, which has been at 2.02 APR since August 2023.
The characteristics of the Remunerated Account are:
The Payroll Account will also remain unchanged:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."

In recent years, there has been a lot of talk about this model with terrible sanctions, but after the intervention of the CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union), it is now normal, similar to doing your income tax return wrong.
On the other hand, most savers have done a tax return from time to time or at least checked a draft of the tax return and confirmed it.
On the other hand, the 720 model is something new for them, and new things are sometimes scary; but it is as simple as filling out a simple form and below we will tell you how to do it.

Novum Bank is offering Spanish savers 2 high-yield deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months and at 3.5% APR and 3.9% APR respectively.
These are bank deposits that can be contracted from €10,000 and up to a maximum of €100,000; always covered by the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD), in this case of Malta.
Many taxpayers avoid the annual procedure of submitting the income tax return if they are within certain income limits and types of income, because the Treasury considers that adequate withholdings have been applied to these people.
However, if you have had any deposit from the Raisin platform, except Haigton Sucusal in Spain, you will have obtained interest that has NOT been declared to the Spanish Tax Agency, and therefore, you have the obligation to file your income tax return and add said interests obtained abroad."

You have until April 1 to carry out this procedure or you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency.
Some think that since it was declared illegal by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), it should no longer be presented.
But what really happened is that the CJEU indicated that the fines were ""disproportionate"" and undermine the free movement of capital in the European Union.
So the Spanish Government approved a new sanctioning regime, avoiding the illegality declared by the CJEU:
Taxpayers who own any of the following groups of assets abroad that exceed a total of more than 50,000 euros will be required to submit this informative return:
In short, if the total of each of the 3 previous groups of assets does not exceed 50,000 euros as of December 31 of each year, you are not required to present form 720.
Once Form 720 is presented for the first time, in subsequent years, it will only be mandatory when any of the joint balances of the three different blocks of assets mentioned above have experienced an increase of more than 20,000 euros compared to those that determined the presentation of the last statement.
As an example of affected savers, they are people who had contracted Raisin deposits, except Haitong, which is an entity with a branch in Spain.
If you had a lot of money abroad, you would also have to declare it in the Bank of Spain, which requires according to Circular 4/2012, of April 25, which came into force on January 1, 2014:

123,Self Bank offers deposits of up to 3.3% APR for all customers,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/self-bank-ofrece-depositos-de-hasta-el-33-tae-para-todos-los-clientes/,09/01/2024,"Self Bank takes months to make changes to its savings products. We have to go back to the month of October, when I set the profitability of its 4 term deposits that are available to all clients.
This fact contrasts with its activity in the post-summer months:
Your longest-term deposit, the 24-month term, and the one with the lowest profitability (2.75% APR), can be contracted with money that is already in the bank. The other 3, more profitable (up to 3.3% APR), require new money.
It would not be surprising if the entity soon made changes to its products, and it would surely be downward. For now, they are decent offers:
* 1) In the event of early cancellation of the DPF during the first year of its duration, the Client will not receive any remuneration and only the main amount of the deposit will be refunded.
In case of early cancellation during the second year, the interest corresponding to the second year of duration of the DPF will not accrue and, in addition, a penalty or commission for early cancellation of 2.20% will be applied to the principal of the DPF.
Self Bank considers new income, balance increases as a reference to the global position that the client had in the Entity as of September 28, 2023.
The amounts from the cancellation or expiration of other term deposits contracted with the Entity since January 1, 2023 will also be considered “New income”.
In order to contract these deposits, the bank requires you to have the current account Self Account without commissions:
The current account characteristics are:


Self Bank launches another term again, this time for 24 months, but less profitable than the existing ones, at 2.75% APR, which is added to the list of the 3 deposits that the bank had already been offering, which give up to 3 .3% APR.
The lower profitability of the new 2-year deposit is due to the fact that the bank also allows it to be contracted with money that the client already has in the bank, unlike the other 3 that require new money.
Self Bank launches 2 new deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months with returns of up to 3.3% APR and extends the 3-month deposit at 3.05% APR that it had been offering since July.
The 3 deposits do not ask for anything, neither payroll nor linked products, you just have to deposit new money into the bank
Self Bank offers a deposit with a 3-month term and a 3% APR for new money, becoming the most profitable deposit on the market for that term, along with the Facto Account."
124,"BFS NON-cancellable deposits return, and cancelable ones drop again",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/vuelven-los-depositos-no-cancelables-de-bfs-y-baja-de-nuevo-los-cancelables/,09/01/2024,"BFS relaunches its NON-cancellable deposits, the bank's most profitable, but at a lower interest rate. It also cuts cancelable deposits.
The disappearance of NON-cancellable deposits has been a hit and miss, but seeing the difference in profitability between NON-cancelable and cancelable deposits, right now, it is not worth leaving your money trapped without the possibility of recovery.
In mid-2023, NON-cancelable deposits could have interest, since they offered half a point of extra profitability. Now the maximum difference is only 0.15 percentage points.
The interest rate offered by this bank depending on the term is a faithful example of how deposits could evolve in the coming months.
Seeing this panorama, we advise you that perhaps it is time to invest for the long term and with high profitability, for what may come, which will surely be more declines. You already know that it is very difficult for banks to overpay you, but to underpay you, they react much faster:
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The deposits offered are valid until January 14, 2024.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little."
125,"Haitong 4.22% APR, more interesting every day given the rate cuts",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/haitong-422-tae-cada-dias-mas-interesante-ante-las-bajadas-de-tipos/,08/01/2024,"Given the first signs of rate cuts, which the ECB has not yet confirmed, banks have already begun to cut the profitability of their deposits.
The banks on the Raisin platform, Cuenta Facto, Banco BIG, and BFS are doing it and surely more and more will come.
We believe it is time to change strategy. Unlike in recent months, when we told you that short-term or liquid products are better, now it's time to choose long-term.
Everything that comes will surely be less profitable and if it exceeds what is now, it will be just barely.
Today we want to highlight Haitong products with returns of more than 4% APR in terms of 1 and 2 years.
They are the best deposits that currently exist in our opinion: the most profitable and terms long enough to guarantee good profitability while rates fall.
Haitong is a Portuguese entity that markets its products via the Raisin platform, but unlike the rest of the banks, it has a branch in Spain, which gives it a great advantage.
Taking out a deposit in Haitong is as if you were doing it at ING or Orange Bank. You will have personal income tax withholdings and your data will be communicated to the Tax Agency like any other Spanish bank.
The buts are that you need to use the Raisin platform as an intermediary and the FGD is not from Spain (like ING or Orange Bank), but from Portugal, which covers, like here, €100,000 per person.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank. But the 6 and 9 month terms are not long enough to require a cancellation.
>> See more information here
The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."
126,In fact it lowers the profitability of absolutely ALL your deposits,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/facto-baja-la-rentabilidad-absolutamente-de-todos-sus-depositos/,05/01/2024,"Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
Meanwhile, the shorter terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
This would be the third rate reduction in the Italian entity in less than 1 month.
Seeing this panorama, from www.tucapital.es we recommend that you look for long terms to put your money. Things will get worse.
Some interesting deposits are:
The evolution of Facto rates in recent months has been:
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.



Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website.
Facto slightly increases the profitability, from 3.29% APR to 3.55% APR, on deposits with a term of 720 days to 1079 days (2 to 3 years).
Their best deposits, and they are also the most profitable, in our opinion, continue to be the short terms: between 180 days and 209 days and at 4.32% APR, which is similar to what Banco Big offers (4.25% APR at 6 months)"
127,"BFS eliminates its most profitable deposits, the NON-concellable ones, and slightly lowers the others",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-elimina-sus-depositos-mas-rentables-lo-no-concelables-y-baja-ligeramente-los-otros/,04/01/2024,"In the month of December, BFS stopped short the successive increases in the profitability of its deposits, to make the first decrease in years.
This week the bank deals a hard blow to its fixed terms, eliminating its most profitable deposits, those NOT cancelable, and slightly lowering the others, those that do allow early cancellations.
As we indicated last time, the article we wrote about the signs of lower rates (see here), has been like the starting signal for banks to begin reducing what they pay to savers, without the ECB having previously modified the rates, but that the banks already take it for granted. Just look at the drop in the Euribor for the month of December (see here).
Seeing this panorama, we advise you that perhaps it is time to invest for the long term and with high profitability, for what may come, which will surely be more declines. You already know that it is very difficult for banks to overpay you, but to underpay you, they react much faster:
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The deposits offered are valid until January 7, 2024.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
128,Banco BIG also lowers its 3-month deposit from 4% APR to 3.75% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-big-tambien-baja-su-deposito-a-3-meses-desde-el-4-tae-hasta-el-375-tae/,03/01/2024,"Banco BIG, after lowering its 6 and 12 month deposits (see here), now cuts the profitability of its 3-month deposit, from 4% APR, to 3.75% APR.
Banks are anticipating a future drop in interest rates, and are reducing the profitability of long terms. This is what Facto or BFs has already done, and Banco BIG is the second time it has done it.
Last time, it lowered 6 and 12-month deposits by 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points, and now it applies a reduction of 0.25 percentage points to 3-month deposits.
Of course, it leaves your welcome deposit unchanged for 6 months and at 4.25% APR.
In this way, your offer is as follows:
The bank has not yet established a marketing period for this product.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
129,Sabadell continues until January 29 offering you 6% APR for 3 months,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/sabadell-sigue-hasta-el-29-de-enero-ofreciendote-un-6-tae-durante-3-meses/,03/01/2024,"Banco de Sabadell extends its online account without commissions and remunerated at 6% TIN for the first 3 months for new customers until January 29, 2024.
If you are already a customer or after the first 3 promotional months, the account will continue to pay, but at 2% APR.
The promotion had an expiration date yesterday, January 2, 2024, but the entity has decided to extend it.
For savers who believe that deposit profitability will continue to rise a little more in the coming months, this is a great option to consider: 6% TIN for 3 months.
What is most limiting about this product is that it pays a maximum of €20,000; but you will not get more profitability for that money anywhere else during those 3 months, and the bank does not ask you for anything in return: no commissions, no conditions, no permanence.
During this time or after 3 months you can decide whether to take out a high-profit, long-term deposit to protect yourself from future rate drops, which you will do (see here), while your money will be earning as much money as possible.
If you put €20,000 for 3 months at 6% TIN, it means €300 gross in interest, that is, €200 more than what the account normally earns.
Thus, a new client would receive €200 interest bonus for €20,000 in the account in those initial 3 months.
If you left the money for 1 whole year, you would receive €600 in interest; €200 initial bonus for the first 3 months, and €400 in normal interest for the 12 months.
You would get that APR if you leave the money throughout the year:
The 3.039% APR would be the average APR of an investment of your money in said account for 1 full year. But you have no obligation to leave the money throughout the year.
You can take advantage of only the first 3 months (6% TIN) and take it to another bank later. The average APR you get in 1 year will depend on where you put the money for the rest of the 9 months. But for those 3 months in Sabadell, you get a 6% TIN (a little more than 6% APR when you have monthly interest payments: 6.16% APR).
This offer will only be valid until January 29, 2024.

Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
135,Orange Bank Spain will be sold separately and will not be to BNP. What will happen?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-espana-se-vendera-por-separado-y-no-sera-a-bnp-que-ocurrira/,22/12/2023,"In June, Orange Bank began exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas for its sale, but in November we learned that the French entity has decided to sell its business in Spain separately.
In this way, the entity launched a competitive process through which it hopes to receive offers from interested banks.
Potential buyers have the entire month of December to submit their offers, and we will know more next year when the sales process is scheduled to be finalized.
If you are an Orange Bank customer, you don't have to worry. Orange Bank is NOT closing, or going bankrupt, or anything like that.
What happens is that Orange, the company on which it depends, no longer wants to continue in the retail banking adventure and is going to sell it.
For many, it is even good news, because Orange scares many many people. The bad thing is the uncertainty of the new commercial strategy that the entity that acquires Orange Bank will apply.
The only thing we should worry about is the future commercial decision of the entity that acquires Orange Bank.
We do not believe that any entity buys Orange Bank to change from top to bottom. They know their customers will fly.
Perhaps, they make changes progressively, and as things change, we can decide what to do.
We do not know if Orange Bank's banking file will be preserved or eliminated and the entity that buys the bank will be absorbed.
This decision may affect the FGD:
We have experienced a few restructurings:
We can see that in all cases, clients lose out over time, and possibly, the same could happen with Orange Bank.
There is only one exception, Evo Banco which offers a decent account (no commissions and no conditions) and an acceptable deposit (2.5% APR for 12 months).
What do you think will happen with Orange Bank? Leave us a comment below.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

The largest increase affects the 3-month deposit, which goes from 2.8% APR to 3.75% APR. The other 2 rose 0.14 percentage points.
From what some web users tell us, the bank will soon lower the rates on longer-term deposits, although the drop will be slight, but it is already setting a trend: more profitability in the short term and less profitability in the long term. They are, as it were, anticipating a future rate cut.
Its products are very interesting, since it is a Portuguese entity with a branch in Spain. Although you have to contract your deposits at Raisin, the final result is similar to a deposit at ING.
The bank will withhold income tax from you and will communicate your data to the Tax Agency and your money is covered by the Portuguese FGD and of course, you do NOT have to file form 720.
Raisin is a simple intermediary, he has no other involvement.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank. But the 6 and 9 month terms are not long enough to require a cancellation.

The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."

In order to contract these deposits, you need a checking account. The entity has the Multiaccount that has no commissions and is now remunerated:


Caixa Guissona increases the profitability of all its fixed-term deposits, reaching a maximum of 2.75% APR.
They are products with a not very long term: 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and which also have the advantage of allowing you to cancel early; and even if you cancel, the bank would continue paying you for your money at 1% APR.
Caixa Guissona offers 4 deposits, Term Deposits Plus, with a term of up to 1 year and a return of up to 2.5% APR.
They are not the most profitable on the market, but they are very flexible and may be interesting for certain bank clients.
Caixa Guissona offers a 12-month deposit at 1.5% APR with the feature that it is cancelable unlike other more profitable products.
There are few high-yield deposits that allow early cancellation, one of them is Caixa Guissona, although it is surpassed by Wizink, which gives up to 2.5% APR, of course, for longer terms (see here)."

Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
Last week the entity already made a half-point reduction in almost all of its fixed terms.
Facto was one of the fastest to increase the profitability of its products and is also proving to be the fastest to lower them.
Every day we find long-term deposits more and more interesting:
The evolution of Facto rates in recent months has been:
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.



Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website.
Facto slightly increases the profitability, from 3.29% APR to 3.55% APR, on deposits with a term of 720 days to 1079 days (2 to 3 years).
Their best deposits, and they are also the most profitable, in our opinion, continue to be the short terms: between 180 days and 209 days and at 4.32% APR, which is similar to what Banco Big offers (4.25% APR at 6 months)"
139,What are the best deposits to protect us from lower rates?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/cuales-son-los-mejores-depositos-para-protegernos-de-la-bajada-los-tipos/,20/12/2023,"There are increasing signs that deposits will decline, and therefore we must get ahead of events and prepare for what may come. We tell you what products are on the market to protect you from possible rate drops.
The ECB has already announced that it will lower interest rates in spring 2024, if inflation modeling is confirmed.
The banks are anticipating this fact via Euribor, which fell slightly in November, but in December it will remain below 4%, dropping almost half a point. The current average value for December is 3.742% and will be even lower than that of May 2023 (3.862%).
Some entities are already transferring this to deposits:
We think there are 2 solutions and depending on what you think how the types will evolve:
You must have the money available in case a good opportunity arises to invest long term and ensure a good return in the coming years.
In addition to some promotional accounts such as Sabadell, Openbank or MyInvestor, balance increase deposits such as ING.
Terms of 2 or more years, without exceeding too much. More than 3 years is too long for a deposit, in our opinion, but you must decide.
At 1 year, we do not recommend it, because if it starts to go down, it is difficult to change things in 12 months. You already know that banks go down quickly and they expect a lot to go up.
1-year offers are, for example, Pibank at 3.34% APR or Banco Big at 3.25% APR.
Are we forgetting any other offers? Leave us in the comments below.


The beginning of October will come with some quite important news: rate increases on some accounts, expiration and/or renewal of offers. The market is on the rise and will continue to do so, we believe, at least until the end of the year.
Some of the most recent news announced are the increase in rates and other offers will expire their marketing period... they will renew it. We tell you
In the last year, the profitability of deposits has only gone up and up. Right now we can find 3% deposits without problems, and there are offers that have reached 4% APR and even more.
But what is the best deposit? The answer is not simple, it depends.
Month after month we are seeing how small entities are increasing the profitability of their deposits, currently giving up to 2.83% APR (We are talking about deposits in Spain or with a Branch in Spain).
However, the big banks, the same ones who were full of mouths saying that if the ECB charged for deposits (that's a lie, not all the money we put in the bank they deposit in the ECB, see here), they They had to pass it on to their clients."
140,Has Openbank called you to offer you the exclusive deposit at 3.5% APR?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/openbank-te-llama-para-ofrecerte-el-deposito-exclusivo-al-35-tae/,19/12/2023,"Until now, Openbank offered its exclusive deposit at 3.5% APR and a 12-month term via email to clients, but recently it is also doing so by telephone.
You already know that the month of December is the month of closing the status of the accounts of the financial entities, and as always, the banks want to have beautiful numbers, and it seems that Openbank is lacking liquidity or at least, not as it would like. .
Hence, their persistence with their clients to bring new money to the bank or try to retain what is already there.
One of our users tells us that the bank is already being annoying, sending him multiple emails and recently calling him by phone to convince him.
Others tell us that when he tries to withdraw money from the bank, if it exceeds a certain amount, the bank ""blocks"" the operation until he speaks with an operator who counteroffers him with this deposit (see here).
A 3.5% APR and 12 months at Openbank represents a substantial improvement with respect to its general offer (see comparison below), surpassing it in everything; and it is not that far from the most profitable deposits on the market.
This deposit does not ask for anything in return:
Looking at both products, we can say that Openbank's general offer is completely outdated and out of the market.
This exclusive offer is much better, and as we said, not so far from the 4% APR of Banco Big, Facto, Haitong or other entities.
In any case, at the moment the ECB pays for banks' liquidity at 4% (Deposit facility: see here). Anything that means paying less than 4% is a benefit for the bank.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
141,Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of its Savings Account up to 3.5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bank-norwegian-sube-hasta-35-tae-la-rentabilidad-su-cuenta-de-ahorro/,18/12/2023,"Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.5% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
It surpasses Renault Bank (2.89% APR) by more than half a point or EBN Banco (3% APR for €10,000) and even surpasses the accounts offered by some collaborating banks on the Raisin platform, such as CKV (3.3% APR ), Klarna (3.29% APR) or Distingo (3.20% APR).
It falls behind the Trade Republic account (4% APR), but the latter is not a savings account, but a Cash Account.
The evolution of Norwegian's account has been spectacular, from 0.5% APR, in January, 1.25% APR, in March, 2% APR, in June, 2.5% APR, in November, 2 changes, 3.3% APR and 3.4% APR, and now in December at 3.5% APR.
Of course, we see that the latest increase is much lower than previous times, but 3.5% APR, liquid money, is a great offer; But lately we must look at the long terms, in case the evolution of rates reverses.
Very short-term deposits (3 months) from Banco Big or Facto at 4% APR are also available, which are more profitable. In addition, Norwegian has some disadvantages:
It is just a Savings Account, similar to the ING Orange Account. You will not have any additional services.
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The account characteristics are:
The money is guaranteed by Sweden's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.
At the beginning of February, in your Client Area, the entity will provide you with the annual declaration of your account for what you take into account in the income tax return.
In any case, making the 720 model is not complicated as we tell you here, and declaring the interest is not that big of a deal either.


Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.7% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
The Norwegian Bank, Bank Norwegian, increases the profitability of its account by one tenth of a point more, to 3.7% APR, 0.2 percentage points more.
It is one of the most profitable on the market for liquid money.

142,BFS LOWERS the profitability of its deposits after 2 years of increases,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-baja-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-despues-de-2-anos-de-subidas/,16/12/2023,"BFS stops short the successive increases in its deposits of the last 2 years. This week the entity has decided to lower the profitability of its products, especially those with longer terms.
Thus, the 3-year term suffers a drop of 0.8 percentage points, while the shorter terms almost do not decrease; in fact, the 12-month cancelable term rises by 0.1 points.
Our article on signs of rate cuts (see here) has been like the starting signal for banks to begin reducing what they pay to savers, without the ECB having previously modified rates.
First it was Cuenta Facto (see here), which also chained 2 years of increases, and now BFS another of those that has offered the most during this entire period.
As we already indicated during the last week, it is increasingly interesting to move our money to some long-term and highly profitable product.
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The deposits offered are valid until December 24, 2023.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
143,Trade Republic (4% APR) with complete bank file and clients with Guarantee Fund,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/trade-republic-4-tae-con-ficha-bancaria-completa-y-clientes-con-fondo-de-garantia/,14/12/2023,"Trade Republic has obtained a complete banking record from the ECB, so it will be able to start trading and bank deposits throughout the euro zone.
Its star product in Spain is its securities account, which is not a savings account, which pays 4% per year for uninvested cash and up to a maximum of €50,000.
The features of this account are very good:
The only thing that had a dark point that we did not know about and now we have been informed and we can tell you that everything is OK; and it has nothing to do with your bank account.
We doubted the guarantee of €100,000 per client when its website indicated that the money was kept in a global account in one of its associated banks.
Now we can tell you, which is correct, that account is an Omnibus account, a global account where the operations of one or several clients are recorded, a normal thing in foreign investments.
The important thing is that each client's investments, which are recorded in the Omnibus account, are covered by the investor guarantee systems of each country; the equivalent of Spain's FOGAIN.
That is, since Trade Republic's global account is in the EU, each client who has positions in said account has a guarantee of €100,000 in the event of bankruptcy by the Investment Guarantee Fund of the country of residence of the depositary bank.
It seems strange to us that a ""broker"" offers these rates for savings. Its function is to earn from commissions on the purchase and sale of securities, not to raise money and lend (traditional banking).
As we said on other occasions, a possible explanation could be that the entity wants to make itself known with this promotion, and attract customers and hope that they invest in its products.
Plus, they don't really lose money on this trade. The money of clients who are liquid, without investing, can be deposited in the ECB and recover that 4%, which is what the ECB pays for bank deposits (deposit facility).
Trade Republic is a foreign entity without a branch in Spain and, therefore, you have:
But really, by not depositing more than €50,000, you forget about model 720 and you only have to declare the interest earned.


The beginning of October will come with some quite important news: rate increases on some accounts, expiration and/or renewal of offers. The market is on the rise and will continue to do so, we believe, at least until the end of the year.
Some of the most recent news announced are the increase in rates and other offers will expire their marketing period... they will renew it. We tell you
Trade Republic will also increase the profitability of its account from October 1, 2023, but double it, up to 4% annually, as announced on its website and will pay up to €50,000 at that interest rate.
Will it be worth moving money from Renault Bank's Contigo Account to Trade Republic this time? The question could be extended to the rest of the accounts that give much less than Renault Bank.
With the interest rate at 4.5% in the Euro Zone, the Euribor at more than 4% and above all, the ECB's deposit facility, what the central bank pays to the banks that park their money there, is in 4%; We would all think that it would be relatively easy to find deposits or accounts at 4% APR.
But reality is not like that. Yes, there are offers at 4% APR, but they are from foreign entities, some with a branch in Spain and of course, they are small and/or newly created and all online."
144,Gambling Provider Stocks: Is It Worth Investing?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/acciones-de-proveedores-de-juegos-de-azar-merece-la-pena-invertir/,14/12/2023,"The gaming world has seen transformative development in recent years, especially in the online sector. One platform that epitomizes this trend is https://www.casino777.es/, one of the leading online gambling websites. In this dynamic context, the question arises: is it worth investing in shares of gambling providers? This question goes beyond a purely financial perspective and requires a thorough analysis of economic, regulatory and ethical aspects.
The gaming sector has not stopped growing for years. The growing acceptance of online gambling, the liberalization of legislation in several countries and the increase in demand for gambling products contribute to this trend. As a result, many gaming companies have significantly increased their turnover and profits, which in turn has attracted the interest of investors.
Globalization and market liberalization have allowed gaming companies to expand their activities beyond national borders. Many countries have relaxed their gambling laws to attract foreign investment. This evolution has led to an increase in business volume and profits, since companies can operate in different parts of the world.
Innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and blockchain have revolutionized the gaming experience and opened new business opportunities. AI is used for personalized recommendations, fraud detection and improving marketing strategies, while VR offers an immersive gaming experience.
The popularity of sports betting has increased, especially in relation to major sporting events. The relaxation of the legal framework for sports betting in many countries has led to an increase in betting activities. E-sports, betting on online video games, are also gaining importance and offer an additional source of income for gambling providers.
An investment in shares of gambling providers offers the opportunity to benefit from the economic opportunities of this sector. Companies in the gaming sector are not limited to traditional casinos, but are also expanding into online gaming. Increasing digitalization is opening up new markets and allowing companies to increase their reach. This could generate solid returns for investors in the long term.
The gaming sector offers a multitude of economic opportunities that permeate various aspects of the industry. Of note is the continued growth in revenue in the sector, driven by the growing acceptance of gaming, especially online. New technologies and the global expansion of markets contribute to increasing company income. The gaming industry not only creates a considerable number of direct jobs, but also indirect jobs, in casinos and in the areas of marketing, software development and customer service.
The gaming sector not only supports large international companies, but also offers space to small entrepreneurs and start-ups, especially in the areas of online gaming, software development and innovative technologies. Additionally, gambling companies often invest in events, shows, and entertainment to attract customers. This helps promote the creative industry and creates opportunities for artists, event organizers and other professionals in the leisure sector.
One positive aspect in favor of gaming stocks is the continued innovation of the sector. Technological advances such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing the way gaming is presented and experienced. Companies that invest in innovative technologies could be more competitive in the long term and attract new target groups.
The use of artificial intelligence is one of the key innovations in the gaming sector. AI algorithms are increasingly used for various purposes, such as personalized recommendations to players, fraud detection, and optimization of marketing strategies. These applications allow companies to obtain more precise information about player behavior and adapt their services more effectively.
The introduction of virtual reality has brought a revolutionary dimension to the gaming experience. Virtual reality technology allows users to immerse themselves in immersive and realistic virtual environments, an especially attractive feature for online casinos. This innovation is helping to improve the traditional gaming experience and attract new customers.
Blockchain technology has also made its way into the gaming sector by integrating transparency, security and fairness into the gaming process. By using smart contracts on a blockchain, gambling companies can build trust and minimize the possibility of manipulation.
Mobile technologies have made access to gambling even easier. With the proliferation of smartphones, gamers can access their favorite games from anywhere, making the sector accessible to a wider audience. Technological advances have also fueled the rise of e-sports and virtual sports betting. These innovative forms of gaming take advantage of the growing popularity of online video games and virtual sporting events.
Despite the positive growth trend, gaming providers also face regulatory challenges. Many countries are tightening their laws and regulations for the gaming industry in order to strengthen player protection and combat illegal activities. This can create uncertainty among investors, as the legal framework can change and affect the commercial activities of companies.
Another important aspect when considering gambling reserves is the ethical dimension. Gambling can lead to addiction problems and many governments are implementing measures to promote responsible gambling. Investors should consider whether their investment supports the promotion of potentially problematic behavior and what impact this could have on the image and long-term sustainability of companies.
As with many sectors, gambling also carries risks. The sector is known for its volatility, which is influenced by various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory changes and even social trends. Investors must be prepared to deal with fluctuations and diversify their portfolios accordingly to minimize risks.
When evaluating the stocks of gaming companies, investors should also look at their financial health. The ability to pay dividends can be an indicator of a company's stability and growth potential. Additionally, key figures such as the price-to-earnings ratio and debt are important factors that can inform the valuation of the stock.
The decision to invest in gaming securities is complex and requires careful consideration of opportunities and risks. While the gaming sector offers growth opportunities and is driven by technological innovation, investors must also consider regulatory challenges, ethical concerns and inherent volatility. A balanced portfolio that includes different industries and sectors can help spread risk and provide stable returns over the long term. Ultimately, each investor should carefully consider his or her own risk appetite, financial objectives, and ethical considerations before deciding whether or not to invest in gambling-related securities.

Your 2-year deposit at 3.85% APR looks more attractive every day due to signs of possible drops in deposits. Something that is already happening on the Raisin platform (see here), and Facto, which announced it yesterday, and comes into effect today (see here).
In fact, we can see in the graph of the evolution of Renault Bank's own products how it has been rising and now it has flattened, and that point could be the maximum, to begin to turn around.
In the long term it is only surpassed by Haitong (see here), up to 4.22% APR and is similar to the BFS offer (see here), up to 3.85% APR.
As for your account, at 2.89% APR, it is still very competitive, after the latest hike. It is a very interesting offer if you still want to spend a little more, and wait for higher rates, or you simply need to have liquid money.
EBN Banco (see here) is more profitable, at 3% APR, but the difference is minimal, and the limitation of only €10,000 as the maximum remuneration from EBN will prevent money from leaking to this entity.
But given the choice in the short term, better Facto Account or BIG Bank. Both entities offer a 3-month deposit at 4% APR.
Already. You will say that they are a deposit, not an account. True, but a 3-month period is so short that we could practically consider it as accounts.
In addition, Banco Big's offer allows you to make early cancellations, risking only the interest generated.
2.89% APR versus 4% APR is a lot of money:
Offer valid until January 15, 2024.

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

146,ING extends its welcome deposit at 2.75% APR until January 31,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ing-amplia-hasta-el-31-de-enero-su-deposito-bienvenida-al-275-tae/,12/12/2023,"ING will offer, 1 more month, until January 31, 2024, its welcome deposit at 2.75% APR and a 4-month term.
The entity's existing clients have, at the moment, only until the end of the year, December 31, to take advantage of this offer if they have new money.
This product was launched at the beginning of September and only for that month, but it has already been extended several times.
It is an offer that attracts many savers, but it is not a big deal if we compare it with entities like Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here) that offer a 4% APR for 3 months without asking you for anything in return.
ING has gained such a reputation that now, without giving great offers, they attract a huge amount of money and clients that sometimes we do not explain (see here).
The characteristics of this product are:
Today the new interest rate for the Orange Account comes into effect, which will pay up to 1.5% APR if you also have the Payroll Account:
The profitability of your deposits depends on the term and the capital invested:
The rest of the characteristics of this deposit are:


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
147,Openbank raises its welcome savings account to 2.27% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/openbank-sube-hasta-225-tae-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-bienvenida/,12/12/2023,"Openbank has raised its Welcome Savings account from 1.76% APR to 2.27% APR during the first year and for a maximum of €100,000.
It is an increase (not bad) of half a percentage point, up to 2.27% APR, in a savings account of a subsidiary of Banco Santander, which does not require anything, neither payroll, nor receipts, nor income.
In any case, it is only a welcome bonus that lasts for 12 months and is one-time use. There are other entities that give more than 2% APR and without asking you to be a new customer.
Additionally, Openbank allows you, if you have a payroll, to sign up for the Welcome Payroll Savings account. The interest rate on this account is much more interesting: 5.12% APR. But it limits the maximum remuneration to only €5,000.
In this way, you could have: €5,000 at 5.12% APR and another €100,000 at 1.75% APR.
The characteristics of both accounts are:
In the event that you direct debit your payroll, you additionally receive a 0.5% bonus on the bills you direct debit for electricity, gas, telephone, mobile phone and Internet.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
148,"Facto LOWERS the profitability of all your deposits, it no longer reaches 4% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/facto-baja-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos/,12/12/2023,"If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website.
It is a decrease of half a point in almost all its fixed terms, and it loses the maximum limit of 4% APR, remaining at 3.75% APR, which offers it between 180 and 209 days of term.
Be careful, tomorrow it's time to renew rates at Renault Bank, which is a very good option for people who think long term: 3.89% APR for 2 years. Haitong also has interesting long-term deposits: 4.22% APR for 2 years.
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
Facto slightly increases the profitability, from 3.29% APR to 3.55% APR, on deposits with a term of 720 days to 1079 days (2 to 3 years).
Their best deposits, and they are also the most profitable, in our opinion, continue to be the short terms: between 180 days and 209 days and at 4.32% APR, which is similar to what Banco Big offers (4.25% APR at 6 months)"
149,"€350M from savers who think they have it in a deposit at Revolut, and NOT",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/350me-de-ahorradores-que-piensan-que-lo-tienen-en-un-deposito-en-revolut-y-no/,12/12/2023,"More than 350 million euros has been captured by Revolut in its Flexible Account among Spanish savers according to a press release issued by the bank itself.
In fact, our country is where it has raised the most money, ahead of 21 other countries where it has a presence.
It is that its ""account"" that ""pays interest daily, and up to 3.9% yield"" and ""withdraws funds when you need it"", makes many not resist the temptation.
Plus, now, it has a new friend plan style promotion. They use existing clients to attract new clients by giving them an incentive of €150.
In this way, more and more people will invest in this product and will not know that they are investing in an investment, not a savings product.
To begin with, it is NOT a bank account and is not covered by the FGD. It is an investment product, more specifically a Monetary Fund.
Therefore, the money you invest in that ""account"" does not remain in Revolut as liquid money, but in securities referenced to assets that will fluctuate.
The bank itself clearly warns that ""the value of investments can fluctuate and you may receive less than the original investment or lose the full value of the initial investment.""
Furthermore, ""past performance and forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future results.""
And finally he washes his hands saying that the bank ""does not provide investment advice, so, as an individual investor, you will have to make your own decisions or seek independent advice if you are not sure that an investment is suitable or suitable for you."" .
The above in small print, but in GIGANTE it says: ""Your security first"", which makes us feel safe in our investment, but NO, that security is ""advanced protection against fraud, strict security functionalities and security service."" 24/7 customer service.
Revolut's solvency affects the Revolut Account, which is a traditional bank account.
The money we put in that account, the bank invests in whatever it considers, leaving a small reserve for reimbursements.
In case the bank does it wrong, and goes bankrupt, the money deposited in this account is guaranteed up to €100,000 per person by the FGD, in this case the Lithuanian one.
In the case of the Flexible Account, it is totally different. You put the money in the account, and the bank invests it in a Monetary Fund and you are the owner of said participation.
Revolut is simply an intermediary that takes your money and invests it. In the event of Revolut bankruptcy, you should not worry, you have the fund shares.
In short, the money in the Flexible Account is in a separate accounting of the bank. You have no bank risk.
The risk of this account is what you invest the money in. By putting money in this account you become an investor, in this case of a monetary fund.
A monetary fund obtains its profitability from the positive evolution of interest rates. There are no more risks if you invest in Euros. This is not the case if, for example, you invest in dollars, you would also be exposed to the exchange rate.
Currently, the outlook for the evolution of the interest rate is positive, so everything will be fine for these funds as long as the situation persists.
But be careful, the ECB has already said that it intends to lower interest rates in spring if the moderation of inflation is confirmed.
Revolut offers great liquidity to the Flexible Account, but everything can change.
It indicates that it allows you to withdraw funds at any time, but establishes a daily limit of 5 million euros. Be careful, it is not per client, but in TOTAL. And currently there are 350 million euros saved from Spanish savers.
But what happens if interest rates suddenly start to fall and your profitability drops or even starts to lose. People will want to withdraw their funds... Don't you see the problem?
Monetary funds are not liquid money, but are invested in things (public treasury, company debt...) and although they have very long payment terms, you must wait until they mature, and if you want it sooner, someone has to buy it from you and It will be at the price that they want to buy it from you. You won't know it, but it will translate into the amount of money that Revolut returns to you.
If you read the information on their website, everything is confusing, and they continually review SAVINGS, SAVINGS, SAVINGS. But it really is an investment.
The general press does not help either, they only echo the bank's statement and are misleading. They talk about accounts, deposits, savings, and NO. We repeat, it is an investment.
As an investor, although with a more conservative profile, you must be aware of things; From one day to the next everything can change, it will depend on the monetary policy of the ECB, and if you invest in dollars or pounds... well, even more worried about the currency exchange rate.
…and from www.tucapital.es we ask ourselves: What need does a saver have to get into this mess by having short-term deposits that earn the same amount right now?
We remind you that in 2017, 40 of the 49 super-safe monetary funds lost money (see here).


The profitability of the Revolut Flexible Account reached up to 3.97% as of January 15, 2024, which the entity announces on its website.
That almost 4% APR, which you add to the ""account"" that ""pays interest daily"" and ""withdraw funds when you need it"", makes many not resist the temptation.
If you read a Revolut news item in the press and see that it offers a 3.7% APR. Be careful.
Your normal account, the Revolut, if it is a traditional bank account, with FGD and services. But the Flexible account, the one that gives you 3.7% APR, is not a bank account.
We made it clear in our previous post that the 3.4% Revolut account is NOT a bank account and not covered by the FGD. It is an investment product, more specifically a Monetary Fund.
We explain the risks."
150,"Eye! Yes, there are signs of declining profitability in bank deposits",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ojo-si-que-hay-senales-de-bajada-de-rentabilidad-en-los-depositos-bancarios/,11/12/2023,"Over the last 2 years we have seen how the profitability of deposits has been rising non-stop.
This has not been seen in large entities such as Santander or BBVA, but the rest of the banks, a little or a lot, have been increasing their offers to capture money from savers in exchange for higher profitability or bonuses.
This upward movement was seen before in Raisin's collaborating entities: foreign banks that offer deposits to Spanish residents; and unfortunately, we are now seeing the opposite movement: announcements of rate cuts week after week.
In short, there are signs that we are reaching the maximum rates on deposits and it may be advisable, at some point in the near future, to take out a long-term deposit to guarantee good profitability in the coming months/years.
We are subscribed to a partner platform (FinancialAds) that sends us the changes made by Raisin's collaborating entities.
Through these emails we can track the changes made to all these banks on the platform. In order not to bore you with data, we leave you only the changes made since September 2023 (emails received since then).
Positive changes are still observed, but there are increasingly more negative ones:
The ECB intends to lower interest rates in the spring if the moderation of inflation is confirmed.
At the moment, the interest rate is at 4.5% and the deposit facility, which pays banks to park their money at the ECB, is 4%.
Since the deposit facility is at 4%, it means that the bank can get 4% without doing anything by putting your money in the ECB. Hence the bank rates around 4% Raisin APR.
However, this is not what is seen in Spain, there are few banks that offer these rates. That is why we believe that they will continue to rise, but surely not in the long term or very long term.
In our opinion, short-term offers are still attractive, but if you find a deposit at 4% APR and with a term of 1 to 2 years, even 3 years, it would be interesting to evaluate it.
Of course, always with money that you know you won't need at this time.
…And you?
Some examples:


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little."
151,Betting or casino: where are there more chances to win?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/apuestas-o-casino-donde-hay-mas-posibilidades-de-ganar/,07/12/2023,"How often or how much you win from online betting depends entirely on the game you choose. In slot games, it is mainly the win multipliers that repeatedly provide free spins or additional cash prizes. However, in sports betting in particular, probabilities can be actively modeled.
At bet777 sports betting, you can only select single bets on the most popular sporting events. It is also possible to place matched bets, which pay much larger sums to winners if all conditions are met.
One of the best tactics to win big at online sportsbooks and other games of chance is to first come up with a plan to win. There are successful players who rely on getting big jackpots, which are always offered in the online casino. Other real money players prefer to win money constantly with many small bets, although then the winnings are smaller. The size of the round bet can also influence the amount of money you win. In poker, for example, the conversion factor is 35 if a single number from the box is matched.
With a round bet of ten euros, you win 350 euros in a single round of play. With a bet of 5 euros, the winnings are halved to 175 euros, but in the online casino you can also play with a chip value of only one euro, for example.
Online gambling is programmed with random parameters that are intended to create a realistic gaming experience. The fact that the calculation of probabilities must be fair is regulated, among other things, by the State Treaty on Gambling in Spain. All licensed online gambling providers meet strict requirements and offer their players fair odds.
In the case of online bookmakers, the calculation of system bets is often so difficult that these providers offer a special odds calculator. This allows betting enthusiasts to get an immediate overview of potential winnings without having to deposit any money. An artificial intelligence tool on the online sportsbook's website can also be very useful in calculating accumulator and system bets. Once you have found a value that is easy to take in the event of a loss, but will provide you with a lucrative sum in the event of a win, you can place your final bet online.
Similar to system bets in lottery games, it is possible to customize your round bet at any time online with the sportsbook. The more individual outcomes you bet, the higher the winnings will be. At the same time, of course, it becomes increasingly difficult to win an entire betting slip if you bet on too many individual factors.
With online bookmakers, you can not only bet on the outcome of a match in live betting. There are also individual and professional sports talents within a team that are worth betting on. If your favorite team plays in a foreign stadium, this can influence your sporting performance. When betting on tennis matches, betting professionals also pay attention to the surface of the court, as this and other circumstances can have a decisive effect on the development of the match.
A special calculation system can be used to devise over/under strategies, which are especially relevant for goal betting. Sure bets on shots on goal have a value of less than 4.5 goals per match, but this average value can also bring big profits to risky sports betting fans on an over/under bet.
Seasoned sports betting professionals also like to bet on late goals that are scored between the 76th and 90th minutes of the match. Betting on an underdog team can be just as promising for a victory in ball sports as betting on a draw.
If you make the most of all the opportunities to place sports bets skillfully on a single bet slip, you can expect to make big profits. However, a bet slip is completely lost if only three of the four events occur as planned. In this case, the entire bet slip and therefore the entire bet for the round is lost.
For this reason, the most astute sports betting fans resort to individual betting slips, which summarize a maximum of two or three sporting events. In the event of a win, the partial sums are multiplied and credited to the user's account as a full win. This is the great attraction of system sports bets that can be freely combined in a strategic way. However, to protect against large losses, it may make more sense to bet on only one or two events per bet slip. With simple bets, you will receive significantly less money in case of victory, but the risk of a complete loss is also drastically reduced.
Anyone who creates multiple accounts with online gambling providers receives a welcome bonus for each new registration. It is available after deposit in the user account area and often depends on the percentage of the cash deposit. This type of bonus cannot be used for all the games offered, but you can often win fun and entertaining free spins for slot machines at an online casino.
In poker, the odds of winning vary over the course of a single round of play, so you have to reevaluate the cards in your hand over and over again. Some casino providers offer an overview, usually sideways, that shows at a glance the winning chances of the cards in your hand compared to the face-up cards. This makes it easier to fold once and abandon a round hopelessly.
Alternatively, you can calculate the odds of winning depending on the card system shown after each new card revealed. Experienced poker players recognize flush, straight or full house more quickly than beginners and therefore win more if they systematically leave the game when the odds of winning become negative.
In this popular casino card game, an unfair advantage can be gained by closely observing and analyzing the cards played. If such manipulative behavior is detected at the online casino, the associated account is immediately blocked from further participation. Blackjack basically consists of collecting a value of 21 cards. However, you also win against the dealer if you get a lower total amount with the cards in your hand, but the dealer outbids and maintains a final value greater than 21.
Almost everyone knows that today online games are the favorite leisure alternative for many Internet users. People who prefer to stay in front of their mobile phone or computer screen rather than go for a walk with friends or play sports. Most people think that spending hours and hours immersed in the world of gaming or in a roulette casino has no health benefits, quite the opposite. But is that really true? In this article we show you some benefits of online games for your health."
152,Bankinter raises your Account WITHOUT commissions and WITHOUT conditions up to 1.5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bankinter-sube-su-cuenta-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condicionas-hasta-el-15-tae/,05/12/2023,"Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower:
In this way, for accounts with amounts less than €25,000 the profitability does not change, but if the balance is higher, the new offer offers slightly more monthly interest.
However, despite this change, the offer is not good, without going outside the bank, its subsidiary, Evo Banco, offers much more (see here).
And if we compare it with the best offers, Bankinter's is a joke:
In any case, for a Bankinter, it is not bad at all. The big banks, except Sabadell, are not offering anything.
The Sin account is an online account that can be contracted by new clients and that remunerates you from 1% APR and up to 1.5% APR, without limits and for an indefinite period.
The characteristics of this account are:
Offer available until December 31, 2023 for new customers who sign up for the account through bankinter.com.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Some users of our website have sent us to analyze the Bankinter Ibex 35 Structured Deposit. At the outset we tell you that these products are misleading and normally the customer does not win."
153,Banco Sabadell offers its Online Account at 6% APR for 3 months to new customers,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/el-banco-sabadell-ofrece-su-cuenta-online-al-6-tae-durante-3-meses-a-los-nuevos-clientes/,04/12/2023,"Banco Sabadell gives another twist to its Online Account. Since December 1, the bank offers new customers a 6.16% APR for 3 months and for a maximum of €20,000.
In this way, the bank once again offers an extra bonus to new clients, when in November it established the same conditions for everyone: 2% APR for a maximum of €20,000 for an indefinite period.
It becomes the most profitable account on the market without asking for anything in return, although, as we have already said, limited in time: 3 months. It sounds like the offers from many years ago (around 2010).
After this bonus period, the profitability drops to 2% APR as for the bank's current clients.
If you put €20,000 for 3 months at 6% TIN, it means €300 gross in interest, that is, €200 more than what the account normally earns.
Thus, a new client would receive €200 interest bonus for €20,000 in the account in those initial 3 months.
If you left the money for 1 whole year, you would receive €600 in interest; €200 initial bonus for the first 3 months, and €400 in normal interest for the 12 months.
You would get that APR if you leave the money throughout the year:
The 3.039% APR would be the average APR of an investment of your money in said account for 1 full year. But you have no obligation to leave the money throughout the year.
You can take advantage of only the first 3 months (6% TIN) and take it to another bank later. The average APR you get in 1 year will depend on where you put the money for the rest of the 9 months. But for those 3 months in Sabadell, you get a 6% TIN (a little more than 6% APR when you have monthly interest payments: 6.16% APR).
This offer will only be valid until January 2, 2024.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or has a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

It is an interesting offer, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big or Cuenta Facto (4% APR), we believe it falls behind.

The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
155,"After Black Friday, EBN lowers the maximum profitability of its deposits to 3.4% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/tras-el-black-friday-ebn-baja-la-rentabilidad-maxima-de-sus-depositos-hasta-el-34-tae/,30/11/2023,"EBN bank changes the interest rate of the entity's 2 longer-term deposits. The maximum return drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here).
The curious thing is that the entity has increased the profitability of its 3-year fixed term, which was at 3.2% APR, now it will give 0.2 percentage points more, up to 3.4% APR.
The rest of the features are:
EBN, since October 1, 2023, offers its Remunerated Account at 3% APR and for all clients. Too bad it's only for the first €10,000, and hence the possible interest on your deposit over 3 months and at 3% APR:
The characteristics of your account are:
NOTE: If you put, for example, €60,000 in the bank: the first €10,000 is remunerated at 3% APR; The next €40,000 is remunerated at 1.5% APR and the rest (€10,000 is not remunerated).
This account is without commissions, without demands. It is a savings account so it does not accept direct debits, debits, or payment operations using credit or debit cards.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank increases the profitability of several of its deposits for Black Friday, which will last between November 16 and 27.
This extra profitability, of up to 3.6% APR, affects fixed terms of 4, 12 and 24 months and will be very close to the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big ( see here)."

This offer consists of giving you cash, from €35 to €500, if you increase the balance in your account between November 29, 2023 and February 19, 2024:
Well, it looks good until you read the fine print:
We are going to analyze considering that we contracted your deposit for 6 months that is remunerated at 2% APR or 3% APR depending on whether you domiciliate the payroll.
The extra bonus would be added to the profitability of the deposits, and we will calculate the APR taking everything into account, and in the best case:

Worth? It's a milonga and a headache. Whatever you do wrong, you will not achieve that indicated profitability. Why doesn't the interest rate increase and that's it?
Why all the fuss and stories, if other banks give you a 4% APR clean of dust and straw.

At the outset we tell you that these products are usually misleading and normally the customer does not win.
The characteristics of this specific product are, as they have sent it to us and based on that we will comment:
The profitability of the product depends on the behavior of the Ibex 35 Index shares over a period of 1 year and 6 months.
If on the expiration date, the final price of the Ibex 35 Index is greater than or equal to 100% of its Initial Price:
Data that is misleading or could lead to confusion:
In short, if I put the conditions in the following way, savers would last longer if they invested:
The structured ones are a bet with the bank to obtain more or less profitability. A saver cannot go betting on his interests, at least in our opinion.
Furthermore, this product is not more profitable than the most profitable deposits on the market such as Banco Big or Facto: 4% APR from 3 months.

Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.

It now offers deposits of up to 3% APR if you make a deposit of more than €100,000, but it does not leave out the most modest ones either.
You can access your deposits from €1, however, the profitability will be lower: starting from the 2.1% APR, passing the 2.35% APR and 2.6% APR, up to that 3% APR mentioned.
It all depends on the term chosen: 6, 12 or 18 months and the money you are going to invest:
The rest of the characteristics of this deposit are:
In November 2020, the bank decided to charge commissions starting in April 2021 for customers without a payroll account and to deposit more than €30,000 in the orange account. Come on, I didn't want your money (see here).
In November 2022 (see here), the bank eliminated these commissions and timidly returned to remunerate its orange account and a little later relaunched deposits.
Now, in November 2023, the bank offers you more profitability the more money you carry, and without asking you to be a new customer, without you bringing new money to the bank, without you having a payroll account, etc.
If you are a new customer or if you bring new money to the bank, the entity offers you a 4-month deposit at 2.75% APR:
This offer will be available until December 31, 2023.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

Its evolution has been spectacular, from 0.5% APR, in January 1.25% APR, in March, 2% APR, in June, 2.5% APR, in November, 3.3% APR, and now 3 .4% APR.
Of course, we see that the latest increase is much lower than previous times, but 3.4% APR, liquid money is a great offer.
In any case, we continue to prefer very short-term deposits (3 months) from Banco Big or Facto at 4% APR. In addition, Norwegian has some disadvantages:
It is just a Savings Account, similar to the ING Orange Account. You will not have any additional services.
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The account characteristics are:
The money is guaranteed by Sweden's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.

Santander, which has a presence in 4 European countries: the United Kingdom, Poland, Portugal and Spain, offers more in all of them than in Spain for Savers' money.
The most striking cases are those of the United Kingdom and Poland, where the bank gives 5% APR or more for deposits. It is true that its currency is not that of the EU (Euros). But we can be objective if we look at the interest rate on these currencies and what the bank gives savers for their money:
I wish they offered 4% or similar in Spain. The case that is closest to us is Portugal (Euros), there it is giving more than 2% APR, half the price of money, even so, we would like it.
Surely there will be fine print in all the offers from those countries that we have not evaluated, but even with all the demands in the world, Spain does not offer anything. On the Banco Santander website, DEPOSITS DO NOT EXIST.

161,How is the probability of winning in a casino calculated?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/como-se-calcula-la-probabilidad-de-ganar-en-un-casino/,24/11/2023,"Casinos are popular places for those looking for excitement and entertainment, but they are also known for their mathematical advantage in all online casino or sportsbook games.
However, understanding how the probability of winning is calculated at a casino can give players an advantage in making informed decisions and enjoying their gaming experience more intelligently at vulkanbet peru or another online casino.
Casinos offer a wide variety of games, from slot machines to blackjack and roulette tables. The basis of all these games is chance and probability. In essence, probability refers to the possibility of an event occurring. In a casino, this translates to the probability of winning or losing in a particular game.
One of the key concepts in the gaming industry is the “house edge.” This refers to the mathematical advantage that the casino has over players in the long term. Each game has a different house edge, meaning that the casino has a higher chance of winning compared to the players. For example, in blackjack, the house edge is low, usually around 1%, while in slots, it can exceed 10%.
In card games like blackjack and poker, players can influence the outcome through their decisions. To calculate the probability of winning in these games, mathematical and statistical strategies are used. For example, in blackjack, players can count cards to determine when favorable cards are most likely to appear. This allows them to adjust their bets and decisions to increase their chances of winning.
In games such as slot machines and roulette, where the player's skill plays a limited role, the probability of winning is based on mathematical calculations and fixed probabilities. For example, in slot machines, the probability of winning is determined by the configuration of the symbols and the combinations that activate the prizes. In roulette, the odds are based on the probability of the ball landing on a specific number or color.
Regardless of which game you choose, it is important to have a bankroll management strategy. This involves setting a limit on the amount of money you are willing to spend and sticking to it. It is also essential to understand that in the long run, most players will lose money due to the house edge. Therefore, it is essential to enjoy gaming as a form of entertainment and not as a source of income.
What is RTP?
RTP (Return to Player) is a term widely used in the world of online slot casinos and online gambling. It refers to a percentage that represents the amount of money a player can expect to win back over time in a specific game. In essence, RTP is a measure of the generosity of a game.
For example, if a game has an RTP of 95%, it means that, on average, players can expect to get back 95% of their investment in the long term. The difference between 100% and the RTP is considered the casino's edge. Players often look for games with higher RTPs, as this suggests they have a better chance of getting their money back. However, it is important to remember that RTP is based on long-term statistics and does not guarantee individual short-term wins.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun. However, beyond the entertainment, there are valuable lessons about managing personal finances. Each decision made in roulette or blackjack, for example, contains strategies applicable not only in the game, but also in our daily finances.
In the wide universe of online gaming, Nomini Casino shines as an oasis of fun and excitement. In an environment where the daily routine can be tedious, having a trustworthy and entertaining space to relax is essential.
With a wide variety of games ranging from the most popular slots to classic table games, this online casino offers a unique gaming experience for every type of player.
One of the main advantages that in-person casinos have is that payments made within the premises are executed immediately. That is, players can acquire the casino's currency or chips quickly and, if they win, they can request the exchange of their chips or credits into real money instantly."

BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.

163,"At BBVA, threats also work: it offers you 2.75% APR to retain you",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/en-bbva-tambien-funciona-los-amagos-te-ofrece-275-tae-para-retenerte/,22/11/2023,"That the banks want liquidity is a fact, because among other things, they only have to put it in the ECB and they obtain 4% annual interest. Anything that means paying less than that is profit for the bank, and there are few entities that offer that.
So why are there no offers? The reason or fault lies with the savers themselves and the connivance of the big banks not to start a deposit war.
In the first case, people are too lazy to move their money, to which is added the distrust of putting their money in small or less prestigious banks or with apparently less solvency/reliability, which are the most profitable.
A great example is how ING has evolved: in the beginning, offering a lot and being distrusted by many, it grew with difficulty; Now, with prestige, it offers the normal and attracts like the most (see here).
In the second case, the big banks: BBVA, Santander, Sabadell, CaixaBank (we can even put ING in this group) have a lot of liquidity from their clients just because, and without having to pay anything for it. Why offer anything and raise the rabbit?
If all the big banks offer nothing, nothing will change, the flight to the small banks is negligible. They are fine like this. They have billions of euros in deposits that pay nothing and earn a lot, why change?
At most, this is what ING, Openbank (of the Santander group) do, and now we have learned that BBVA, try to retain liquidity once they know they are going to leave the bank.
Yes, when you start a process of transferring your money to another entity, without even completing the process, the bank counteroffers you with a deposit with a return much higher than what they normally give you.
ING has offered a 3% 12-month APR (see here), Openbank at 3.15% 12-month APR (see here) and BBVA at 2.75% 12-month APR, which we will discuss below.
We encourage all of you to move your money, when you see your status quo in danger, you will start to do something and pay what we really deserve for our savings. Anything that involves paying less than what the ECB pays the banks is a SCAM.
If you start a money transfer process from BBVA to any other bank for a normal amount (€5,000 or perhaps €10,000), the bank offers you a 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR (there could be different offers).
Several users of our website and bank clients have communicated to us in this regard, although we have almost no details.
If you are customers, you can try and tell us what they offer you in the comments.
This offer is a thousand times better than its general offer, 0.65% APR and on top of that combined with investment funds.
It is clear that BBVA wants liquidity, we already talked about in a previous article in which BBVA offers a 4.25% 12-month APR in Italy just for opening your account without commissions.
Money in Italy and Spain are worth the same. We would like to see that offer in Spain (see here).

The French entity set its savings account at 2.89% APR on November 8 and fixed its bank deposit at 3.85% APR on September 13, 2023, and will continue like this until next December.
Both the account and the deposit are good options. The first for liquid money and the second for people who think that rates are already peaking and want to ensure a good return on their money in the next 2 years.
However, the offers from Banco Big or the short-term offers from Facto, both at 4% APR for 3 months, must be making things difficult for Renault Bank, especially for the Contigo Account.
A fixed term of 3 months is so short that we could practically consider it as savings accounts, and Banco Big also allows you to make early cancellations, risking only the interest generated.
2.89% APR versus 4% APR is a lot of money in 3 months:
The positive evolution of Renault Bank rates seems to be slowing down. There was a rapid rise from May 2022 to May 2023 and since then, it has grown at a slower rate:

The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little."

It serves both payroll, pension and unemployment benefit, as long as it is greater than €900 net per month and a stay of 12 months.
In the case of an unemployment benefit, this permanence is not necessary; in exchange, the client must make recurring income of €900 for 12 months from the first direct debit of the benefit.
In case of non-compliance with the permanence, a penalty will be applied to the client that will be calculated by multiplying the payment of €120 by the days remaining until the end of the permanence period and dividing it by 365 days.
The process to get this bonus is as follows:
Openbank expressly excludes those who have had their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit direct deposited between April 1, 2023 and November 19, 2023 (both included)
for amounts over €500.
Also excluded are those who have benefited in the last 5 years from a campaign in which it has been established as a requirement to domiciliate the payroll, pension and/or unemployment benefit in Openbank and that was associated with the delivery of some product or incentive payment.

Their best deposits, and they are also the most profitable, in our opinion, continue to be the short terms: between 180 days and 209 days and at 4.32% APR, which is similar to what Banco Big offers (4.25% APR at 6 months)
Facto stands out over Banco Big, by being more flexible, letting you choose the days of duration of your deposits within given limits and does not require you to be a new customer.
Their 3-month to 6-month deposits are also very good, at 4.06% APR. Being so short-term, it is as if they were a savings account, but much more profitable than these.
There are some who believe that it is time to take something long-term, because rates are reaching their ceiling. In this sense, Facto can also be a good option, although there are better offers such as Renault Bank (3.89% APR for 2 years) or Haitong (4.22% 2-year APR).
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
167,New deposits new money from Evo Banco: 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/nuevos-depositos-dinero-nuevo-de-evo-banco-31-tae-a-4-meses-y-285-tae-a-12-meses/,20/11/2023,"Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
Logically, it falls short if we compare it with Banco Big or Facto. These 2 banks offer a 4% APR without requiring anything from you, it can be with money that is already in the bank.
In any case, the more competitors there are in the market, the better for savers.
Both deposits have the same characteristics, except for the term and profitability:
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco.
The offer is valid until January 31, 2024.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco increases the profitability of its Smart Account from 2.5% APR to 2.85% APR, and guarantees that profitability for more than 1 year; but only for new clients.
The profitability of 2.85% APR will be given to you until January 31, 2025, and only from February 2025 onwards, the bank will apply the general conditions of all clients, which is currently not competitive at all."

Yes, in Italy and without conditions",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/deposito-al-425-tae-y-a-12-meses-en-bbva-si-en-italia-y-sin-condiciones/,20/11/2023,"The mistreatment that banks subject Spanish savers to is shameful. BBVA is offering in Italy a deposit at 4.25% APR and a 12-month term, and even if you cancel the deposit early, the entity would continue paying you 1% APR for your money.
This is the ""Flexible Deposit"", which can be accessed by opening the ""BBVA Current Account without commissions forever"", very similar to the online account that it sells here in Spain:
The characteristics of the deposits are:

As we said, it offers an online account without commissions and without remuneration for new clients.
It also offers a 13-month deposit, but you need to invest at the same time in an investment fund (minimum 30% in fund), in exchange the bank rewards the deposit with an ""extraordinary"" 0.65% APR.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
169,VPN: What it is and how it can benefit students in the era of online learning,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/vpn-que-es-y-como-puede-beneficiar-a-los-estudiantes-en-la-era-del-aprendizaje-en-linea/,17/11/2023,"Virtual education and online learning have become fundamental elements of the modern educational experience.
As more students turn to the web to access educational content and collaborate on online projects, the need to protect online privacy and security arises.
It is normal for doubts to arise in different circumstances about what a VPN is. This is a Virtual Private Network, for its acronym in English.
It is a tool that makes users connect securely to the Internet by encrypting their data traffic and routing it through remote servers. This hides the user's IP address and protects their information from potential online threats.
A VPN allows students to access online content that might be geographically restricted.
This is especially useful when you need to consult specific academic resources from other countries. With a VPN, you can bypass these restrictions and make the most of the educational resources available around the world.
Online security is essential, especially when it comes to personal and academic data.
A VPN encrypts your Internet connection, meaning any information you send or receive will be protected from potential threats like hackers and cybercriminals.
This is essential to keep your data and browsing history safe.
In some places, online censorship may be an issue, potentially limiting access to certain educational websites and platforms. A VPN can help you get around these restrictions and access the information you need without problems.
Students often work in public places such as libraries and cafes, where public Wi-Fi networks are common.
These networks may be vulnerable to cyber attacks. A VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting your data, protecting you against potential threats on these public networks.
A VPN allows students to access virtual education and content that might be geographically restricted.
This is especially useful when you need to consult specific academic resources from other countries. With a VPN, you can bypass these restrictions and make the most of the educational resources available around the world.
Online collaboration is an important part of online learning.
By using a VPN, students can collaborate on projects and communicate with their peers securely and privately, which is essential when it comes to sharing academic information and research data.
When choosing a VPN for your online learning experience, it is important to consider several factors:
Make sure the VPN offers a high level of security and data encryption to protect your personal and academic information.
Speed ​​is crucial when it comes to learning online and collaborating on projects. Look for a VPN that offers fast and stable connections.
Choose a VPN that has servers in different geographic locations to ensure you can access educational content from anywhere in the world.
To maintain your privacy, choose a VPN which has a logging privacy policy that does not store your online activities.
The VPN should be easy to install and use, even for those who are not tech-savvy.
Choosing a suitable VPN is essential to ensure an optimal online learning experience.
In addition to the factors mentioned above, you should also consider compatibility with your devices, as some VPNs offer apps for a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.
Also, research user reviews and seek recommendations from online security experts to make an informed decision.
In short, to the question of what a VPN is, it is a valuable tool for students looking to get the most out of their online learning experience.
Provides access to restricted content, protects online privacy and security, and facilitates secure collaboration.
By choosing the right VPN, students can ensure that their online learning experience is efficient, secure, and free of geo-restrictions.

An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
In 2018, when ING did not give anything, NN Bank offered 0.3% APR on its account (see here), and while the rest of the banks continued to lower the remuneration of their accounts, and even charged for our money, NN Bank offered 0.5% APR (see here), and even had a friendly plan in the style of its ""partner"", ING, offering a welcome bonus of €20.
In fact, it was one of the most profitable accounts for months (see here), but with the rise in the price of money in the Euro Zone, NN Spain was left behind.
A little less than 1 year ago we wondered what was happening to the bank (see here), since the rest of the banks raised rates, NN Bank did not react.
Months later, in May, the bank posted a sign stating that the savings account cannot be contracted temporarily (see here).
And definitely, on September 19, 2023, the bank sent its clients a communication indicating that it will close their accounts on November 20.
It will be the end of the history of an entity related to ING (years ago the insurer, Nationale Netherlanden, were the only offices of ING), with whom it went hand in hand for a long time, it will have had a short-lived adventure in the world of savers .

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"
171,"EBN increases 3 of its deposits for Black Friday, up to 3.6% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-sube-3-de-sus-depositos-por-el-black-friday-hasta-el-36-tae/,16/11/2023,"EBN bank increases the profitability of several of its deposits for Black Friday, which will last between November 16 and 27.
This extra profitability, of up to 3.6% APR, affects fixed terms of 4, 12 and 24 months and will be very close to the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big ( see here).
The biggest increase is experienced by the 4-month deposit, which rises from 2.5% APR to 3% APR, matching what your Savings Account offers.
The 12-month rate rises from 3.2% to 3.35% APR and the 2-year rate rises from 3.15% APR to 3.6% APR.
The rest of the features are:
Looking at its characteristics, its most profitable deposit, the 2-year one and the 3.6% APR of the promotion, it is not so interesting as it does not allow early cancellations.
EBN, since October 1, 2023, offers its Remunerated Account at 3% APR and for all clients. Too bad it's only for the first €10,000, and hence the possible interest on your deposit over 3 months and at 3% APR:
The characteristics of your account are:
NOTE: If you put, for example, €60,000 in the bank: the first €10,000 is remunerated at 3% APR; The next €40,000 is remunerated at 1.5% APR and the rest (€10,000 is not remunerated).
This account is without commissions, without demands. It is a savings account so it does not accept direct debits, debits, or payment operations using credit or debit cards.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

Thus, for the remainder of the year, whether you are a new customer or an existing customer of the bank, you can access this deposit, which was launched in September and has already been extended several times.
The entity considers new income:
We know that the entity has many loyal customers, who will benefit from this product, but as always, we have to tell them that there are better offers such as Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here) that offer a 4% APR to 3 months without asking you for anything in return.
The characteristics of this product are:

NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account.
In 2018 we welcomed NN Bank as a possible successor to ING by offering profitability on the accounts as much as ING charged for storing its clients' money.

The entity is insistently sending this offer to its clients via email. In fact, it has been offering deposits of this style since the summer.
Logically, the interest rate has varied over the months. Initially, it was at 2.75% APR, then it rose to 3.15% and now to 3.5% APR.
For those who have not received this email, it is possible that if you try to transfer your money to another entity, the bank will offer you a counteroffer with this product or a similar one, as we saw a couple of weeks ago (see here).
This deposit does not ask for anything in return:
It is a clearly superior offer to the general one (2% APR for new money), and offers even more than the deposit required by direct debit of a payroll (3% APR).
Looking at both products, we can say that Openbank's general offer is completely outdated and out of the market.
This exclusive offer is much better, although it is not enough if we compare it with the products of up to 4% APR from Banco Big, Facto, Haitong or other entities.
Keep in mind that the ECB pays for banks' liquidity at 4% (Deposit facility: see here). Anything that means paying less than 4% is a benefit for the bank.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

I send you this message to share with you, as well as with all of us who follow your website, what the conditions of the current Deutsche Bank DB Account promotion hide. After reading it, you can see that it is actually practically impossible to get the 360 ​​euros they say, since to direct a payroll the first thing you have to do is open the account itself and, only once we have it open and know With the same number we can proceed to direct debit the payroll, which is not always achieved in the same month. Therefore, as the bonus only applies ""until the end of the twelve (12) month period from opening the account (not 12 months from the receipt of payroll/pension/SEPE benefit)"" (taken literally from the document published by said entity), it is literally impossible to obtain more than 11 monthly incentives of 30 e. each, which amounts to a total of 330 e.
On the other hand, it must be taken into account that the account carries a quarterly maintenance fee of €60 in the event that ""the conditions of a monthly payroll of more than €2,000 and a minimum average balance of €50,000 are not met,"" (also extracted literally of said document).
Therefore, be very careful with the promotion because it is not as good as it seems and hides a ""poisoned candy"" that must be taken into account.

Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.
Deutsche Bank launches an offer to capture payroll, of at least €2,000 per month, with a bonus of €360 and a return of 2% APR on the account.
As we can see, it tries to capture large payrolls, and for large capitals, because it requires keeping at least €50,000 in the account to give you that 2% APR."

It is far from the best offers, but it is an interesting option for bank clients who do not want to leave the bank.
Additionally, for the money that is already in the bank, the entity offers online deposit at 2.01% APR and a term of 12 months.
The deposit money must come from the payment of transfers issued from other banks or from the deposit of checks issued by other financial entities, during the 15 business days prior to the creation of the deposit.
The entity offers a savings account at 1.76% APR without commissions or conditions.
This account is only a savings account, it does not allow direct deposit of receipts, cards, or checks, nor can it be a support account for other products such as insurance or securities accounts.


Cajamar continues to offer its liquidity raising deposit, called Depósito Hola, at a decent profitability of 3.03% APR and a term of 12 months.

Several financial entities that offer money, up to €350, in exchange for your salary, and end their promotional campaign at the end of March.
But some, like Bankinter, have already renewed their offer and extended it until the end of June.
In November we have up to 6 entities that offer money if you direct your payroll to their bank. Your salary has value, at least they spend it to get it from you, offering you up to €350 in cash.
Of course, they will ask you, like mobile or internet companies, for a permanence and some other demands."

This offer has been in force since the summer with the peculiarity that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term.
If you are a client of the entity and you are too lazy to move, a 3.1% APR is an interest rate in the range of those we consider already interesting and the 12-month term is not excessively long.

The characteristics of this product are:
This offer is valid outside of Galicia and will be valid until December 31, 2023.


Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.

180,Bank Norwegian raises its Savings Account to 3.30% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bank-norwegian-sube-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-hasta-el-330-tae/,08/11/2023,"The Norwegian Bank, Norwegian, increases the profitability of its account to 3.3% APR from 2.5% APR and is the most profitable accounts on the market.
It is more profitable than Renault Bank (2.89% APR) and even surpasses the accounts offered by some collaborating banks on the Raisin platform, such as Klarna (3.03% APR) or Collector (3.05% APR).
Its evolution has been spectacular, from 0.5% APR, in January 1.25% APR, in March 2% APR, in June 2.5% APR and now, 3.3% APR.
As we said about the Renault Bank offer, we continue to prefer very short-term deposits (3 months) from Banco Big or Facto at 4% APR. In addition, Norwegian has some disadvantages:
It is just a Savings Account, similar to the ING Orange Account. You will not have any additional services.
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The account characteristics are:
The money is guaranteed by Sweden's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.
At the beginning of February, in your Client Area, the entity will provide you with the annual declaration of your account for what you take into account in the income tax return.


Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.7% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
The Norwegian Bank, Bank Norwegian, increases the profitability of its account by one tenth of a point more, to 3.7% APR, 0.2 percentage points more.
It is one of the most profitable on the market for liquid money.
Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.5% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
It surpasses Renault Bank (2.89% APR) by more than half a point or EBN Banco (3% APR for €10,000) and even surpasses the accounts offered by some collaborating banks on the Raisin platform, such as CKV (3.3% APR ), Klarna (3.29% APR) or Distingo (3.20% APR)."
181,Renault Bank raises its savings account to 2.89% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-sube-hasta-el-289-tae-su-cuenta-de-ahorro/,08/11/2023,"Renault Bank, after remaining unchanged throughout the month of October, slightly increases the profitability of its savings account to 2.89% APR.
This is an increase of 0.15 percentage points, and places it as one of the most profitable Spanish IBAN accounts on the market, only behind some promotional and linked or limited accounts.
The previous changes made by the bank were in the month of September after the holiday period:
With this increase, the difference with respect to EBN Banco (see here) at 3% APR is minimal, and the limitation of only €10,000 as the maximum remuneration from EBN will prevent money from leaking to this entity.
However, the biggest problem is facing the Facto Account or Banco BIG. Both entities offer a 3-month deposit at 4% APR.
Already. You will say that they are a deposit, not an account. True, but a 3-month period is so short that we could practically consider it as accounts.
In addition, Banco Big's offer allows you to make early cancellations, risking only the interest generated.
2.89% APR versus 4% APR is a lot of money:
As for your 2-year deposit, it remains unchanged at 3.85% APR. It is a product that has never interested us because of its long term and because it is not cancelable. We have always said that there are other better offers.
But for those who think that we are reaching the remuneration ceiling, this product would be interesting, since it guarantees you almost 4% APR for 2 years. Of course, make sure that you will not need the money during all this time.

Offer valid until November 21, 2023.

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
182,"Banco Big offers EVERYONE the Top Deposit at 4% APR and a 3-month term, as Facto",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-big-ofrece-a-todos-un-4-tae-a-3-meses-como-facto/,07/11/2023,"If Facto increased its deposits after Banco Big took out its deposit at 4.25% APR for 6 months for new clients, now Big reacts to Facto and gives a 4% APR to everyone and for a 3-month term.
Facto offered 3 months at 3.25% APR and raised it to 4.06% APR. Banco Big, which offered that term at 2.25% APR, now offers it at 4% APR.
In this way, it becomes the 2 entities that give the best profitability to your savings in the short term. The duration of the deposit is so short that you have practically liquid money.
In addition, Banco Big allows you early cancellations (an advantage over Facto), and as a penalty you are left without the interest generated:
NOTE: Facto allows you to contract the deposit from 90 days to 179 days.
Banco Big offers 2 other deposits to all clients with 6 and 12 month terms, with the same characteristics as the 3 month deposit:
The bank has not yet established a marketing period for this product.
Recently, Big Bank raised its Big Big Account from 0.1% APR to 1% APR.
The account characteristics are:
The Banco Big paid account is commission-free and has a Spanish IBAN, but under the Portuguese FGD. It is ING-style, but its headquarters are in Portugal.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
183,ING continues and adds: more clients and more deposits. Inexplicable?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-sigue-y-suma-mas-clientes-y-mas-depositos/,07/11/2023,"ING continues and adds, it already has more than 2.5 million clients in the Payroll Account, and half a million in the NoCuenta account, in total, more than 4 million, 3.8% more than 1 year ago.
These are data that we do understand, because ING has built a very high level of loyalty and a good reputation in terms of operation and good image.
What we do not understand is its growth in the Orange Account. In this period it has attracted almost twice as many accounts as it did 1 year ago (180%), when what it offers is laughable if we compare it with the most profitable ones: it gives less than half.
The number of deposits has also increased, up to 46,639 million euros, 10% more than 1 year ago. Of which, 34,420 million are remunerated in the Orange account or in deposits.
Already in the first 6 months, ING stood out among online banks, both in attracting liquidity and in the total amount of deposits, but with a big difference:
ING went from charging clients commissions for having more than €30,000 in the Orange account if they did not have the payroll account until November 1, 2022 to remunerating your money in the account or offering you a deposit at 2.75% APR in September 2023.
The improvement in conditions is clear. He started the year with his 2 deposits with 12 and 18 month terms at 0.6 and 0.85% APR and his account at 0.5% APR and 0.7% APR if you have payroll, and ended in September, at 1 .75% to 2.25% APR on your deposits and the account 0.85% APR and 1.25% APR with payroll.
Another important fact is that before the end of September, as well as at the end of each quarter, the bank has launched a promotion to raise new money for 4 months and up to 2.75% APR.
So, in principle, the fact that ING has raised more money could be understood in a certain way by how its offer has evolved.
But what is not understood is that at the beginning of 2023 there were 44 billion euros in ING. Nor is it understandable that it has raised so much more money than the rest of the online banks, when its offers are much better:
In short, those who continue with their money in ING are losing a lot of interest.
Let's imagine super optimistically (I don't think it's even half of it) that the 34,420 million euros remunerated from ING were in their 3-month deposit at 2.75% APR. Do you know how much money they are earning less if they were in Facto?
There are more than 100 million euros, on the low side, which will surely be double or more, that these clients are losing by not moving their money from ING to Facto.
In short, with the data on the table, ING has no need to offer anything more. It is already raining clients and liquidity.
Are you still at ING?


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

Whoever has contracted the Online Account with the current promotion of 2.5% APR or whatever rate, will continue to charge at that rate during their bonus period. It is a contract and the bank cannot change it.
Once your bonus period has passed, the conditions in force in the Online Account will apply, which is currently 2% APR.
New clients who sign up for the account now go directly to the 2% APR.
In our article we made a comparison between the previous offer and the current one. It's what we always do, compare different offers.
And the changes made to the offer given to savers by Banco Sabadell on November 1 were:
At no time have we indicated to existing clients who are in their bonus period that it will change. They will continue with the conditions they contracted.
In fact, the bank is communicating to its customers with this information:

Customers will continue to enjoy their current promotion until its expiration date. And when your promotion ends, you will still be compensated for your money. Currently, the remuneration of the Account for clients not subject to promotion is 2% APR of profitability for a maximum of €20,000.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

They also offer it to clients who contract or transfer a pension plan to MyInvestor O Finanbest until December 27.
Additionally, clients who invest €300 per month in automated portfolios, MyInvestor brand funds and plans, or Top Sales Fund Selection, will have that 2.5% APR indefinitely.
The characteristics of the account are as follows:
MyInvestor extends the contracting period for its deposits until November 30, 2023.
These are 3 fixed deadlines:
Although these products are not as competitive as deposits are 4% APR or more at those Facto and Banco Big terms.
Yes, it is true that Banco Big's 4.25% APR is for new customers and lasts only 6 months (see here), but if we compare the rest of the products, Banco Big wins in almost everything.
Facto Account would be in another league (see here), since it offers 4.06% APR for 3 months or 4.32% for months.
They also beat them in the 3-month term by offering 3.25% APR.
If we compare only the issue of profitability, MyInvestor has nothing to do with the other 2 entities.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
187,We make ECO of: Orange Bank playpen,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/eco/hacemos-eco-de-corralito-de-orange-bank/,02/11/2023,"A user of our website wrote to us who wanted to share a bad experience: «Orange Bank playpen«. Our only way to help him is by echoing his complaints.
One of the problems of this entity is that it does not have a telephone service for customers. This service is only for canceling cards.
Hello, I am a follower of your website and I like your articles.
I want to share my recent experience with Orange Bank.
Yesterday, the 1st, I tried to log into my account and without having had any prior communication I had to provide some information, account email, validation of my ID, phone number and validation of the same, it is at this moment that I have I have to receive an SMS from them that never arrives (well, it did arrive about 12 hours later at one in the morning).
I tried with multiple phone numbers and turning off spam protection. When no SMS arrived, I sent an email to customer service from which I have not received a response (except for the automatic response if I had received it).
Today, day 2, I repeat the whole process again and everything goes well, but, oops! It is not validated after too many attempts, I try to contact the bank by phone and they only give the option to cancel the card and it is cut off.
The other contact option is through the app's chat, but I can't enter because they don't allow me.
I can only wait until the folks at Orange Bank feel like serving their clients. They cause a problem that causes damage and there are no effective means of contact.
A cordial greeting.
The only thing we can tell you is that you write to them at teayudamos@orangebank.es
It is also effective if you make a complaint on their social networks.
Luck!!!
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

It has no commissions, nor does it make demands; just that you are a new customer of the bank.
In addition, it gives you a 3% bonus on the amount of direct debit bills for electricity and gas, without limits.
It is, from the data point of view, a good alternative. The 2% APR return is not the most profitable, but it is close:
It offers all the necessary services of an operating account:
Comparatively, we believe that Orange Bank (2% APR up to €200,000) or Pibank (without limits) is better, and like Sabadell you have all the services.
But if you are looking for profitability, Renault Bank at 2.73% APR should be your option. But if you want to get even more, you could hire one of the following products:
Furthermore, when we read the conditions of the new Banco Sabadell Online account, it sounded a bit like the old Account 123 of Banco Santander. It can be one thing now, and in a short time the opposite.

Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
191,Facto rises to 4.32% APR at 6 months and 4.06% APR at 3 months term,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/facto-sube-hasta-el-425-tae-a-6-meses-y-4-tae-a-3-meses-de-plazo/,31/10/2023,"Facto raises its deposits from 6 months to 7 months to 4.32% APR and offers 4.06 APR from 3 months to 6 months, without a doubt they are unbeatable in the short term.
It is a clear reaction to Banco Big's 4.25% APR deposit and 6-month term (see here).
The good thing about Facto is that it offers more possibilities by allowing you to choose the days of duration of your deposits, in addition to not requiring you to be a new customer like the Portuguese entity.
It has been an increase of 0.75 percentage points for the shorter terms, and 0.25 percentage points for those of 6 months.
The rest of the terms, from 9 months, remain unchanged, but we believe that their most interesting products are the short-term ones and they are the ones for which the interest rate has increased.
A 3-month term is practically a savings account, and at 4% APR it is great. Even those from 6 months to 9 months. They are short enough that we don't have to worry about the impossibility of early cancellation.
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
192,New Self Bank deposit for all clients and money for 24 months and 2.75% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/self-bank-ofrece-tambien-a-24-meses-pero-menos-rentable-que-el-33-tae-a-12-meses/,31/10/2023,"Self Bank launches another term again, this time for 24 months, but less profitable than the existing ones, at 2.75% APR, which is added to the list of the 3 deposits that the bank had already been offering, which give up to 3 .3% APR.
The lower profitability of the new 2-year deposit is due to the fact that the bank also allows it to be contracted with money that the client already has in the bank, unlike the other 3 that require new money.
This entity has been quite active in recent months in terms of deposits:
Thus, your offer is as follows:
* 1) In the event of early cancellation of the DPF during the first year of its duration, the Client will not receive any remuneration and only the main amount of the deposit will be refunded.
In case of early cancellation during the second year, the interest corresponding to the second year of duration of the DPF will not accrue and, in addition, a penalty or commission for early cancellation of 2.20% will be applied to the principal of the DPF.
Self Bank considers new income, in addition to transfers and income in the bank, the net amounts from the cancellation or maturity of other time deposits contracted with the entity since January 1, 2023.
Of course, as is normal, the bank requires you to have the current account Self Account without commissions:
The current account characteristics are:


Self Bank takes months to make changes to its savings products. We have to go back to the month of October, when I set the profitability of its 4 term deposits that are available to all clients.
This fact contrasts with its activity in the post-summer months and it would not be surprising if it makes changes soon, but it will surely be for the worse.
Self Bank launches 2 new deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months with returns of up to 3.3% APR and extends the 3-month deposit at 3.05% APR that it had been offering since July.
The 3 deposits do not ask for anything, neither payroll nor linked products, you just have to deposit new money into the bank
Self Bank offers a deposit with a 3-month term and a 3% APR for new money, becoming the most profitable deposit on the market for that term, along with the Facto Account."
193,Experience opening the deposit at 4.25% APR from Banco Big,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/experiencia-abriendo-el-deposito-al-425-tae-de-banco-big/,30/10/2023,"In the month of May, we were one of the clients whose Banco BIG did not manage to open their account and take advantage of their then deposit at 4% APR and a 6-month term (see here).
With the new launch of the 6-month deposit, but now at 4.25% APR, we contacted the bank via email, and surprisingly they answered us, and in less than 24 hours, that we can take advantage of the new offer, if our account opening was not completed last time.
So, we proceeded to the opening:
That's how it stayed last time and we didn't hear anything again; but this time, the next day, the bank already sent us an email saying that the account is already open, it tells us the IBAN number, and we could verify it by entering its APP.
We proceeded to deposit the money by making a transfer from another bank and once the money arrived, we registered the deposit at 4.25% APR:
Everything fast and without errors. Is this also your experience? We thought we would have more problems, because of everything that happened a few months ago.
You can access your account both from the APP and from its website, which is appreciated, unlike Orange Bank which only allows via App.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
194,MyAndBank launches the first deposit at 5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/myandbank-lanza-el-primer-deposito-al-5-tae/,30/10/2023,"In various digital media you can find news about the launch of a deposit at 5% APR from MyAndBank, the digital channel of AndBank, from the same group as MyInvestor.
It would be the first deposit at 5% APR, yes, but not for Spaniards. If you go to their website and read the information carefully, it requires you to sign up for an account and to do so it requires that you be a resident of Andorra.
In addition, it has more drawbacks:
With this deposit, at most, you will get €815 in gross interest, which is not bad for only 2 months, but €100,000.
This offer will be valid until November 10, 2023.
The rest of the products are very similar to those of MyInvestor: Account at 2% APR, deposits at 3% APR for 6 and 12 months. Free Bizum, free international transfers.
We will see if they transfer that deposit at 5% APR to MyInvestor and, therefore, contractable by Spanish residents.


Users and clients of the former entity, Inversis, which was acquired by AndBank, are reporting to us that when opening the MyInvestor Account they are being charged commissions retroactively from previous years (since 2016).
If you have one of these accounts in AndBank, close it as soon as possible, especially if you are thinking of opening an account in
Accounts with ""high"" profitability and no commissions are not extinct. There are and some even more profitable than most deposits.
There are up to 8 accounts on the market that remunerate your money quite well in addition to not charging you any commission and without demanding anything in return.
We never believed that we were going to write the word commission together with ING or the Orange Account.
Of course, I had previously talked about commissions for the debit card or the non-payroll account in Germany if you stopped meeting their requirements.
But charging for the Orange Account, the iconic Orange Account that made ""your money grow day by day"", that ""if you needed your money you took it and the rest continued to grow at ING"" and an example of what it means to save (see image that can still be found online), is unheard of."
195,Car Title Loans: Quick and Easy Option to Consider,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/prestamos-sobre-titulo-de-automovil-opcion-rapida-y-facil-de-considerar/,30/10/2023,"In times of economic uncertainty, many people in the United States are looking for quick and affordable financial solutions. Car title loans have emerged as a popular option, offering individuals the opportunity to get cash quickly, using their vehicle as collateral.
Unlike other types of loans, car title loans offer a more streamlined and accessible process, even for those with less than favorable credit history.
Car title loans are a type of quick credit where the applicant puts their vehicle as collateral to obtain a loan.
The loan amount generally depends on the value of the vehicle and the applicant's ability to pay. What makes this option unique is the speed and flexibility it offers, allowing users to access the funds they need in a short period of time, without the long procedures or excessive requirements that other types of loans usually entail.
Car title loans offer a series of advantages that make them especially attractive. One of the main benefits is the speed of the approval and disbursement process, something crucial in financial emergency situations.
Unlike traditional bank loans, car title loans do not require a perfect credit history or extensive paperwork, making them more accessible to a wide range of people. Additionally, the fact that the vehicle acts as collateral for the loan means that even those with a bad or non-existent credit history can access the financing they need.
Applying for a car title loan is a fairly simple and straightforward process. First, you need to shop around and compare different lenders to find the best deal possible. Make sure you meet all the necessary requirements, such as having the car title in your name and having a stable income.

Next, fill out the loan application, providing all the required information and documents. The lender will evaluate your vehicle and your ability to pay to determine the loan amount, and once the application is approved, you will sign the contract and receive the money. A helpful resource for this process is montanacapital.com, where you can find comprehensive information and personalized advice
Selecting a reliable lender is a crucial aspect when applying for a car title loan. It is important to research and compare different options, paying special attention to interest rates, repayment terms and opinions from other customers.
Montanacapital.com is a good starting point, since it is a company with recognition and experience in the market
Car Title Loans for all types of credit in the US – for people who need money fast and have a varied credit history. This type of loan allows individuals to use their vehicle title as collateral, gaining access to funds without having to rely solely on their credit score. It is important, however, to understand the terms and conditions, as these loans can have high interest rates and could result in the loss of the vehicle if payments are not made on time.
Car title loans are presented as an effective and quick financial solution for those in need of immediate liquidity. Their affordability and flexibility make them an attractive option for a wide range of people, even those with less than favorable credit history. However, it is vital to choose a trustworthy lender and fully understand all terms and conditions before proceeding. With the right information and resources, car title loans can be a safe and valuable financial tool.

In a loan application, employment verification is a process in which the lender verifies the applicant's employment information. This process helps lenders evaluate the risk of granting a loan to a given individual. If a lender requires verification of employment, the applicant will generally be asked to provide detailed information about their current or previous employer, including length of employment and income."
196,"Cetelem raises its Savings Account up to 3% APR, but charges you commissions",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cetelem-sube-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-hasta-el-3-tae-pero-te-cobra-comisiones/,27/10/2023,"Cetelem has increased the profitability of its Savings Account up to 3% APR and without an amount limit, improving the offer of some of the most profitable on the market:
The downside of Cetelem is that to have its products you have to choose one of its 2 plans and in both it charges you commissions.
The plan that offers the 3% APR on the Savings Account is the Premium Plan, which has a monthly commission of €2.99, with an initial bonus until June 30, 2024 of €1.99.
With that you get:
To begin with, we don't like an account that charges commissions, but let's analyze its opportunity cost (see here) compared to, for example, Renault Bank.
Most of you who read us know that Renault Bank works quite well, pays interest on time and is continually raising its rates and is always among the most profitable on the market.
Currently, the French entity gives 2.73% APR (2.70% TIN) without commissions and nothing strange, compared to Celetem's 3% APR (2.96% TIN) with a commission of €3 per month (rounded up) .
So for example, let's analyze for different amounts of investments, logically, we will subtract the interest generated, the bank commissions:
Note1: data are monthly interest settlements.
Note 2: You earn €20 gross welcome bonus and in addition, until June 2024 you get €1 more per month for the reduced commission.
We observed that:
Worth? Tell me yourselves. We do not like that they charge us commissions for such a small difference in profitability and on top of that for large amounts of money.





Due to the disappearance of Orange Bank, and the transfer of clients to Cetelem, the first ""unknown"" problems of this entity appear.
Today we echo a complaint from one of our users and new Cetelem client who complains about the maximum limit that the entity allows in daily transfers.
This limit, of €30,000, is considered insufficient, and that the entity should modify or remove.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
197,"Wow (irony), ING ""has not forgotten the savers"" raises the Orange account to 1% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/guau-ironia-ing-no-se-ha-olvidado-de-los-ahorradores-sube-al-1-tae-la-cuenta-naranja/,26/10/2023,"Seriously, we couldn't resist putting that ironic Wow. ING is sending its clients an email in which it tells them that:
«It has been 24 years since we arrived in Spain (which is said soon!). During all this time, if there is something that we have not forgotten, it is that we came, above all, to be next to savers like you. And, although a thousand things have changed since then, there is one that remains the same as the first day: our desire to continue taking care of your savings.
«Precisely for that reason, today we have something to celebrate. We make our commitment to your savings even bigger with good news.
«We are raising the remuneration of your ORANGE Account again. This time, up to 1.00% APR.”
But what rubbish is this, 1% APR and we have to celebrate it! ING forgot about savers many years ago. Seriously, whoever is still at ING, we don't understand them. Not even those who are in Santander, BBVA, Openbank and a long etc.
Furthermore, the increase does not apply immediately, but will be from November 1, 2023. Right now it is 0.85% APR. Come on, we're counting the minutes until it arrives.
Compare with some competitive offers:
For clients with a payroll account at the entity, the Orange Account will now pay 1.5% APR (from 1.25% APR).
Currently, the profitability of the Orange Account is:

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

198,Openbank can see the duster: Counteroffer 3.15% APR and appeals to fear,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/se-le-ve-el-plumero-a-openbank-contraoferta-315-tae-y-apela-al-miedo/,26/10/2023,"Openbank is seen trying to retain its clients' money through a deposit at 3.15% APR and 12 months, and if it is NOT competitive, it appeals to its ""reputable and large financial institution.""
It's the same old story, playing with customers' fear... but you can shut them up by asking them if Openbank's FGD is better or maybe the other bank doesn't have FGD.
That is what happened to one of our users who today decided to take the step and contract the Deposit at 4.25% APR from Banco Big with the funds he had in Openbank.
During the process of moving the money there were all impediments:
Openbank has increased its ""exclusive offer"", which a few days ago was 2.75% APR, up to 3.15% APR for a 12-month term.
It is a deposit that comes out during the process of transferring your money from Openbank to other entities and has no requirements:
It is a clearly superior offer to the general one (2% APR for new money), and offers even more than the deposit required by direct debit of a payroll (3% APR).
NOTE: the user has an active payroll account in Openbank.
Openbank's general offering to customers is completely outdated and out of the market. Their deposit to retain clients is much better, although it is not enough if we compare it with Banco Big, Facto, Haitong or other entities.
That it tries to retain liquidity is proof that the bank wants liquidity. In fact, everyone wants to. Just think that the ECB pays for banks' liquidity at 4% (Deposit facility: see here). Anything that means paying less than 4% is a benefit for the bank.
What happens is that, from their logic, they think that why pay more if you have thousands and thousands of clients with money at a lower rate. And if someone decides to leave, they give them something else and that's it.
What the bank doesn't understand is that with this strategy it pisses people off, and if they have already decided to leave, it is normal for them to leave, unless your counteroffer is exceptional, which it is not.
Finally, we find it miserable to appeal to people's fear as a last attempt to retain money.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""

Of the 2 products, the most interesting is its savings account: it is a great offer to have liquid money at 2.73% APR.
EBN offers something similar (3% APR), but limits that profitability to €10,000 (see here), while Renault Bank could say that it has no limits (up to €1 million).
On the other hand, your deposit at 3.85% APR and a 2-year term is somewhat short, as it is a very long term and non-cancelable.

The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.

In this sense, the bank has communicated through a press release in which it also indicates that there will be a 3% discount on electricity and gas bills that are direct debited to the account and without an amount limit.
Additionally, you will be given a debit card and a credit card free of charge, with which you can withdraw cash free of charge throughout the Banco Sabadell ATM network.
It will become a universal account, free of charge, without demands, paid and for an indefinite period. It's a shame that the 2% APR is not one of the best, but it would be the first major bank to offer good profitability indefinitely.
It would be double what Bankinter offers in its Online account with similar characteristics (see here), and it is not so far from the most profitable ones such as Renault Bank at 2.73% APR or the 3% APR of Ebn Banco.
If you are interested in this new offer, perhaps you should opt for the current offer, which is somewhat more profitable, take advantage of it and then continue with the 2% APR.
Banco Sabadell offers its Online account until October 26 at 2.5% APR for the first year, and if you also domiciliate your payroll, it will give you €200 in cash.

If you open the account and direct deposit a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for an amount of at least €700, the bank will give you a cash bonus of €200.
The payment of the 200 euros will be made, for registrations in the month of October, during the first 10 days of February 2024.
The bonus is net. The bank is in charge of paying you the personal income tax withholdings that will be deposited into the Treasury. In reality, the bonus paid by the bank is almost €250.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

That 2.85% APR will be given to you until January 31, 2025, and only starting in February 2025, the bank will apply the general conditions of all clients, which is currently not competitive at all.
This is an extra bonus for at least 1 year, but limits this profitability to a maximum of €30,000. In addition, you must have €4,000 in the unpaid account.
The Smart account is about 2 linked accounts:
What the bank does is that on the 15th of each month, it checks the balance of the unpaid account. All balances exceeding €4,000 will be transferred to the term account at 2.85% APR for a period of 4 months, automatically renewable and with full availability without commissions.
Thus, the real profitability of the account will always be less than 2.85% APR, by having money in the checking account without remuneration. We think it is too much trouble, having, for example, Renault Bank at 2.73% APR.
The rest of the features are:
The bank does not require any connection, and you have the liquid money.

You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €120.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.

Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.

Specifically, I am starting today, around 9:15 a.m., a transfer of €9,000 (with balance in the account), to EBN Banco, to take advantage of their 3% APR offer for a maximum of €10,000 from your savings account (see EBN Bank offer).
When entering the data and the amount of the transfer, on the same screen you will see the possibility of contracting a deposit at 2.75% APR and for a 12-month term:

Looking at the details of the offer, the bank does not demand anything:
It is a clearly superior offer to the general one (2% APR for new money), and it is almost the same as what they offer to those who direct a payroll (3% APR).
NOTE: the user has an active payroll account in Openbank.



Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
203,MyInvestor: 3.00% APR only until the end of the month. Comparison: MyInvestor vs BIG vs Facto,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/myinvestor-300-tae-solo-hasta-fin-de-mes-comparativa-myinvestor-vs-big-vs-facto/,20/10/2023,"MyInvestor limits its deposit offer, 2.90% APR for 3 months and 3.00% APR for 6 and 12 months, only until October 31, and we think so, because then it should raise it.
Who will go to MyInvestor if you have Banco Big at 4.25% APR? Because the customer profile of both entities is similar.
Yes, it is true that Banco Big's 4.25% APR is for new customers and lasts only 6 months (see here), but if we compare the rest of the products, Banco Big wins in almost everything.
Only the 3-month deposit is better than MyInvestor, but for that there would also be the Facto Account offers (see here) which surpasses both entities, since it offers 4% from 6 months to a year and a half of term.
They also beat them in the 3-month term by offering 3.25% APR.
In short, between Big and Facto, MyInvestor has nothing to do if we compare only the issue of profitability.
MyInvestor deposits can be contracted if you have an account:

With what has happened in recent weeks/months we can now say that the deposit war has returned, but only for small entities. The big ones like Santander, BBVA or Caixa Bank remain on the sidelines.
The most profitable deposit has already reached 4% APR. A 2% APR is already easy to get and there are more and more offers at 3% APR."
204,Banca March will continue to offer its 12-month deposit at 3.3% APR until December,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banca-march-seguira-ofreciendo-su-deposito-a-12-meses-al-33-tae-hasta-diciembre/,19/10/2023,"Banca March will continue to offer 12-month deposit terms and 3.3% APR until December 31, 2023.
This deposit, which was scheduled to end its marketing period on October 31, 2023, will be available to savers during the rest of the year.
The profitability of 3.3% APR was raised in the month of August from the 2.6% APR that it had been offering.
We believe that the entity should have raised profitability somewhat, because it is insufficient to compete with the best offers on the market that reach up to 4% APR or more:
The good thing about Banca March is that it allows early cancellations, both total and partial. If you do, not only does it not charge you any commissions, but it will continue to pay you interest, yes, at 1% APR, which is not bad at all.
This product is exclusively for new customers who open the Avantio account through digital channels.
The characteristics of this fixed term are:
This product has a dark side, the Avantio Account. It is free only if you have €10,000 invested in a bank product; in addition to other conditions that are easy to meet.
The entity accepts the €10,000 deposit so that you do not pay commissions on the account. So the problem would come after the expiration. You will have to cancel the account or you will have to pay €75 in semi-annual commissions (€150 per year).
The offer will be valid until December 31, 2023.

Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.
The bank set the marketing deadline for this product until April 12, 2023.
Banca March relaunches the Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and now at 3% APR for new digital clients.
It represents a reduction of 0.3 percentage points compared to what the bank offered until December 31, 2023."

Sabadell has been offering this return in its account since April without commissions and without conditions, and it will currently last until October 26, 2023.
It's a pretty good offer, only surpassed by Renault Bank (see here) and now also by EBN (with limitations).
Furthermore, if you direct a payroll of at least 700 euros, the bank will reward you with €200 in cash.

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
206,Banco Big's Large Deposit returns for new customers at 4.25% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/vuelve-el-gran-deposito-de-banco-big-para-nuevos-clientes-al-425-tae/,18/10/2023,"Banco Big relaunches its Great Welcome Deposit with a 6-month term and now at 4.25% APR.
This product was in force until May, offering new customers a 4% APR, and now the entity is bringing it back, but at 4.25% APR, 0.25 percentage points more.
It is a very good offer, because it is a short term (6 months) and excellent profitability, in addition to allowing early cancellations. The only downside is that it is only for new customers.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
The bank has not yet established a marketing period for this product.
Their deposits are more interesting, whose profitability is close to the most profitable on the market, reaching up to 3.75% APR.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
Account at 1% APR
Recently, Big Bank raised its Big Big Account from 0.1% APR to 1% APR.
The account characteristics are:
The Banco Big paid account is commission-free and has a Spanish IBAN, but under the Portuguese FGD. It is ING-style, but its headquarters are in Portugal.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
207,"BFS rises a little more, but still does not reach 4% APR, it remains at 3.85% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-sube-un-poquito-mas-pero-sigue-sin-llegar-al-4-tae/,18/10/2023,"BFS rises a small step further in the profitability of its deposits, but still does not reach 4% APR. It remains at 3.85% APR as the maximum rate.
It is a very very slight increase, only 0.1 percentage points in its maximum profitability that affects non-cancellable deposits of 25 months and 36 months.
But the increase is greater in the other terms and for deposits that allow early cancellation, whose rates were lower.
The increase for the 12-month cancelable deposit is especially interesting, from 3% APR to 3.4% APR. But, despite this increase, it remains behind Banco Big (3.75% APR), although it surpasses Pibank (3.34% APR).
As for the 12-month NON-cancelable deposit at 3.85% APR, it is close to Facto (4% APR) or Haitong (4.10% APR).
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until October 22, 2023.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

The characteristics of this deposit, called “Ven a Arquia deposit” are quite interesting:
The bad thing is that the bank requires links, you must meet one of the following 2 conditions:
These links must be met in the month prior to expiration, and if not, the deposit would be paid at 1% APR, normal, downwards.
As this is an offer only for new customers, existing customers who meet the conditions cannot take advantage of the offer. So whoever wants the 4% APR deposit will necessarily have to make a new connection with the bank.
This offer will be valid until October 31, 2023.


Arquia has reduced its 6-month deposit for new clients registered from January 1, 2024 by half a point, to 3.5% APR.
It has also modified the maximum investment limit, rising from €30,000 to €50,000. In this way, the final reward is greater, but at the expense of having to invest more money.
Arquia offers a 6-month deposit and a 4% APR for new clients and with the possibility of early cancellation.
Anyone who reads that will say that those are 3 very interesting features for a fixed term currently. The problem is the BIG BUT.
2021 will be the third year that Arquia commits the mistake of not allowing its clients to freely close their accounts due to actions by the entity.
The bad thing is that they charge €50 per year in commission for an account that they want to close and they won't let them."
210,Targo Bank is now owned by Abanca. Consequences for its clients?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/targo-bank-ahora-es-de-abanca-consecuencias-para-sus-clientes/,16/10/2023,"Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
At the moment, its Next Account at 2.53% APR and its Impulse Deposit of up to 3% APR are still in force, although the entity has already announced that it will abandon the brand ""gaining momentum"", of course, the future of the 2 products.
Current deposits and accounts do not change when conditions are entered. As we indicated above, the bank still continues to offer the same products.
Once deposits have expired, the money will return to your associated account and by then you have to decide whether to contract again and at the current rate or move it to another bank.
Accounts may undergo changes in conditions with 2 months' notice. You must be attentive to emails or communications via your electronic banking.
The forecasts are not very good, Abanca offers its Clara account at 2% APR for €15,000 during the first year, much lower than Targobank, 2.53% APR for €30,000 during the first year.
Both entities offer a €300 bonus if you also domiciliate your payroll.
Targobank and Abanca customers can now withdraw money for free at all ATMs of both entities. In addition, outside Galicia, it allows you to withdraw 5 times a month in the Euro 6000 and Euro Automatic Cash network. In total there will be about 9,000 ATMs.
Transfers between Targobank and Abanca accounts are now free, as is depositing checks from one bank to the other's offices.
It will depend on what Abanca decides to do with Targobank:
There will be no change in account and deposit number.
The FGD will continue to cover €100,000 per person for the money deposited in Targobank, and another €100,000 per person for the money deposited in Abanca.
Targobank will cease to exist as an entity, and this will be the most predictable.
The clients' account numbers must carry the Abanca account code, that is, there will be a change in account numbering.
Only €100,000 per person will be covered for the sum of the money they have deposited in TargoBank and Abanca, because there will be only one, Abanca.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term.
Abanca continues to offer its online account with a €300 bonus and 2% APR profitability in exchange for payroll until December 31, 2023."

They are the 6 most valued banks, according to the survey carried out with 28,000 users, taking into account the transparency of the products, the ease of operating, customer service, commissions and the most recurring problems.
The top 10 according to this survey are:
Self Bank is in position 14 with 74 points out of 100.
Evo Banco is in 17th position with 74 points.
Bankinter is the first traditional entity to appear on the list with 69 points and in position 18.
You can already imagine that the positions of the large entities will not be very good.
BBVA is in 32nd place out of 44, with 59 points.
Santander obtained 54 points and is in 39th position.
Sabadell with 53 points moves to 40th position.
Caixa Bank suspends with 49 points, occupying the penultimate position.
Unicaja also does the same with 45 points, and occupies the bottom of this list.
ING, Caja Ingenieros and Triodos and in this order are the banks with which their clients are most satisfied during 2017.
Openbank, ING and Arquia are the entities with which their clients had the least conflicts in relation to the collection of expenses and commissions.

ING is chosen as the best bank in Western Europe and BBVA as the best bank in Latin America."
212,All deposits at 4% APR from Raisin. Are they worth it? Comparison,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/todos-los-depositos-al-4-tae-de-raisin-merecen-la-pena-comparativa/,13/10/2023,"On the Raisin platform there are more than 20 bank deposits that offer a profitability of at least 4% APR, reaching up to 4.4% APR. Are they worth it?
There are a total of 9 entities (Banca Sistema, Banca Progetto, Haitong, BluOr Bank, Younited, Klarna, Coop Park, LHV and Bfjord) that come from 6 different countries in the Euro Zone (Italy, Lithuania, Estonia, Portugal, France and Sweden ) and offer 21 deposits with a profitability between 4% APR and 4.4% APR, and with terms as short as 6 months and as long as 10 years.
All entities are of foreign origin, without headquarters in Spain, so the FGD is from their country of origin.
There is only one bank that has opened a branch in Spain, and therefore, the advantages are evident: You do not have to file form 720 under any circumstances, they make withholdings and communicate your data to the Treasury. This entity is Haitong.
Absolutely, all products do not allow early cancellations. So in our opinion, deposits with a term of more than 1 year are not interesting.
The most profitable product at 1 year, the longest term that we recommend, is Banca Sistema which offers up to 4.4% APR. In fact, it is the most profitable on the list.
For that same term, Haitong offers a 4.1% APR, there is not that much difference compared to Banca Sistema and you avoid all the problems of foreign banks mentioned above.
And if we compare with the rest of the deposits in Spain, we have to mention Facto, which is similar to Haitong, with a branch in Spain and FGD in Italy. At 12 months, Facto offers 4.06% APR, practically the same as Haitong. The good thing about Facto is that you avoid an intermediary, plus it has shorter terms and good profitability.
Without a doubt, 4.4% APR is the maximum profitability you can obtain, and the term is good, only 1 year. It is offered by Banca Sistema on the Raisin platform.
For long terms, like 2 years, you also have Banca Sistema at more than 4.3% APR, certainly the most profitable on the market.
But Haitong, with 4.1% 1-year APR, is super competitive, and has the advantage of having a branch in Spain.
However, based on the data evaluated, Facto Account is better: it gives almost the same for 1 year and shorter terms, it offers more profitability, and it is much more flexible in terms of term (you can request a deposit for as many days as you want), It has a branch in Spain, and above all, you DO NOT need an intermediary.
Our conclusion is that if you are looking for every last cent of profitability, Raisin would be the choice. If you don't want to complicate your life with the Treasury, Haitong or Facto, because of the intermediary.
As for Facto or Haitong, it is already a subjective issue. If you are already a client of one of the two banks, then the choice would be quick. Follow where you are. If you are not a client of either bank, we would opt for Facto.
For you, is Raisin worth it? Leave us a comment.



With the interest rate at 4.5% in the Euro Zone, the Euribor at more than 4% and above all, the ECB's deposit facility, what the central bank pays to the banks that park their money there, is in 4%; We would all think that it would be relatively easy to find deposits or accounts at 4% APR.
But reality is not like that. Yes, there are offers at 4% APR, but they are from foreign entities, some with a branch in Spain and of course, they are small and/or newly created and all online.
In the last year, the profitability of deposits has only gone up and up. Right now we can find 3% deposits without problems, and there are offers that have reached 4% APR and even more.
But what is the best deposit? The answer is not simple, it depends.
Banca Sistema increases the profitability of its term deposits contractable through Raisin, up to 1.41% APR.
Also, if you are a new Raisin customer, you can get €150 bonus: €100 welcome and €50 for the friend plan."

The App keeps thinking and thinking once you enter your password, and if you wait any longer, at the end it tells you: ""You don't connect with the bank? It's probably our thing, but just in case, check your connection, thanks!
Yesterday, the entity had another incident, although it did not last long: Just over 1 hour: between 11 a.m. and 12:30 or so.
Today, as yesterday, the bank has not communicated anything to its clients about the problem. These incidents are serious when dealing with an online bank, and it is especially serious in Orange Bank, as they do not even have a telephone number to call, they only give you an email: ""teayudamos@orangebank.es.""
Failures:
NOTE: 10:30. We were able to access the account.
Since September 1, Orange Bank has been giving 2.0% APR in its savings account for customers with an Orange line or former customers (before November 10, 2022) and 1.8% APR for customers without an Orange line.
In summary:
The rest of the features remain unchanged:
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.
On December 19, Orange Bank allows you to open an account without the need for an Orange mobile line. But these customers will receive 0.8% APR instead of 1% APR. Former customers maintain the 1% APR.
On March 1, the bank raised it to 1.5% (Orange clients) and 1.3% APR (without Orange line).
On June 1, it reached 1.8% and 1.5% APR, and in just over 1 month, up to 2% and 1.8% APR.
Orange, the company on which Orange Bank depends, announced that it wants to sell the banking entity at the beginning of the summer of 2023.
It has entered into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas, which already has Banco Cetelem in Spain.
For many, it is even good news, because Orange scares many many people. The bad thing is the uncertainty of BNP's commercial strategy that it will apply to Orange Bank clients.
Nothing should worry the bank's 200,000 clients at the moment. We have had similar cases and we have told them on this website such as that of Ibanesto, Oficina Directa or COINC.
>> See more details of the implications for customers


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

The bank has made two increases in its two products after the holiday period:
Of the 2 products, the most interesting is its savings account: it is a great offer to have liquid money at 2.73% APR.
EBN offers something similar (3% APR), but limits that profitability to €10,000 (see here), while Renault Bank could say that it has no limits (up to €1 million).
On the other hand, your deposit at 3.85% APR and a 2-year term is somewhat short, as it is a very long term and non-cancelable. There are more profitable offers on the market that offer 4% APR such as Haitong and Facto.

Offer valid until October 24, 2023.
Offer valid until October 24, 2023.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."

The Banco Big paid account is commission-free and has a Spanish IBAN, but under the Portuguese FGD. It is ING-style, but its headquarters are in Portugal.
The account characteristics are:
Their deposits are more interesting, whose profitability is close to the most profitable on the market, reaching up to 3.75% APR.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
For a 12-month term, they are not at the levels of Haitong (4.1% APR) or Facto (4.06% APR), but they are third on the list of the most profitable and have the advantage that they are cancelable, unlike the other 2.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

They are products with a not very long term: 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and which also have the advantage of allowing you to cancel early; and even if you cancel, the bank would continue paying you for your money at 1% APR.
They are deposits that are far from the most profitable on the market, which reach up to 4% APR, but they are alternatives especially for the bank's existing clients.
The new returns depending on the term are:

Caixa Guissona has increased the profitability of all its fixed-term deposits to 3% APR.
They are products with a not very long term: 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Allow early cancellations, in which case the bank would continue paying you for your money at 1% APR.
Caixa Guissona offers 4 deposits, Term Deposits Plus, with a term of up to 1 year and a return of up to 2.5% APR.
They are not the most profitable on the market, but they are very flexible and may be interesting for certain bank clients.
Caixa Guissona offers a 12-month deposit at 1.5% APR with the feature that it is cancelable unlike other more profitable products.
There are few high-yield deposits that allow early cancellation, one of them is Caixa Guissona, although it is surpassed by Wizink, which gives up to 2.5% APR, of course, for longer terms (see here)."

Oh really? Bankinter in the last decade has offered that (see here), even when ING charged commissions because people left too much money in the Orange Account (see here).
In fact, Ibercaja has been offering that 5% APR for many months (see here).
Let's compare what has changed in relation to profitability:
Regarding the requirements, it has relaxed the minimum payroll amount:
These requirements also apply to the second year, which previously was:
Our conclusion is that something has improved, but from that to breaking the market... What do you think? Leave us a comment below.
To have all this, you must meet the following requirements:
This offer is valid until March 31, 2024.


Ibercaja, in the style of Account 123 that has already gone down in history, offers a 5% APR during the first year and a 3% APR during the second year. Excellent returns, and endless buts.
Ibercaja extends its offer of cash until December 31, 2021 in exchange for the direct debit of a payroll of at least €1,500 to the entity in the Vamos Account.
This promotion is aimed at new clients and requires a 24-month stay under penalties.
Ibercaja also offers cash to new customers who deposit a payroll of at least €1,500 with the entity in the Vamos Account.

218,Orange Bank out of service,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-fuera-de-servicio/,09/10/2023,"Orange Bank is having problems with its application that leaves its customers without access to their accounts.
We have been receiving reports for about 1 hour from clients trying to access the bank's APP and the only message they are shown is that: ""We have had a problem and we cannot continue.""
We have verified this problem ourselves, we will see how long the incident lasts.
At the moment, the bank has not commented, but it is especially serious, because clients have no other means to access their money. You don't even have access to technical support, because this service is provided by the App itself.
The only means of contact is an email: “teayudamos@orangebank.es.”
NOTE: At 12:00 on Monday, October 9, 2023, the Orange Bank Application is still not working.
At 12:29 p.m. on Monday, we were able to access the account normally
Since September 1, Orange Bank has been giving 2.0% APR in its savings account for customers with an Orange line or former customers (before November 10, 2022) and 1.8% APR for customers without an Orange line.
In summary:
The rest of the features remain unchanged:
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.
On December 19, Orange Bank allows you to open an account without the need for an Orange mobile line. But these customers will receive 0.8% APR instead of 1% APR. Former customers maintain the 1% APR.
On March 1, the bank raised it to 1.5% (Orange clients) and 1.3% APR (without Orange line).
On June 1, it reached 1.8% and 1.5% APR, and in just over 1 month, up to 2% and 1.8% APR.
Orange, the company on which Orange Bank depends, announced that it wants to sell the banking entity at the beginning of the summer of 2023.
It has entered into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas, which already has Banco Cetelem in Spain.
For many, it is even good news, because Orange scares many many people. The bad thing is the uncertainty of BNP's commercial strategy that it will apply to Orange Bank clients.
Nothing should worry the bank's 200,000 clients at the moment. We have had similar cases and we have told them on this website such as that of Ibanesto, Oficina Directa or COINC.

We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

In this sense, the bank is communicating this to its clients via email today.
It is an offer somewhat higher than that offered by the Dutch entity (at 2.75% APR) and everyone knows that it has done well with its strategy in the first 6 months of the year (see ranking below or more detail here).
On the other hand, Evo Banco was the only online bank that closed the month of June with liabilities coming out of its accounts. It lost 90.3 million euros in deposits from January to June, a percentage decrease of 2.4%.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
This promotion is valid until January 31, 2024
The second online entity with the most deposits is Openbank, but like ING it is not because its offer is the best.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."

Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month.
How many payrolls and clients left this bank due to its policy of changing commissions on Account 123, and how much money is being spent to be able to recover part of those clients! Many of them will never, ever return.
The current offer is significantly better than the previous one, especially for normal payrolls:
As requirements:

The account is without commissions and without conditions:
This offer is exclusively for new clients of the bank and without the need to direct deposit the payroll or anything. Only if you want the €300 or €400 bonus, you must direct deposit the income and the 2 receipts, and it is valid until December 31, 2023.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

A similar offer was offered in the month of July, which, like now, is to retain clients who went to ING for the liquidity raising offer with an extra 4-month term.
This ""feint"" deposit is offered by the bank when you have already decided to take the money elsewhere, during the process of transferring your money to another bank.
The current profitability, 3% APR, is 0.5 percentage points more than in July, and 0.25 points more than the deposit deposit, but with a much longer term, 12 months instead of 4.

222,Why the NFT market will continue to grow,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/por-que-el-mercado-de-nft-seguira-creciendo/,04/10/2023,"We are in the digital age, which has some important implications. Overall, there is a growing shift towards the digital world. More and more people are finding opportunities in this new space, which has proven to have enormous potential, more than we can imagine. When cryptocurrencies were launched, there was massive growth in terms of users, applications, and platforms.
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the new block in this crypto space. NFTs emerged recently, but have surged in that short time. The number of people who have moved into NFTs has grown exponentially. This has resulted in similar growth in NFT sales volumes. For example, NFT sales reached $100 million in July 2020. Today this figure has grown a lot.
Following recent trends, investment in NFTs is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. That is due to the attractiveness and advantage of this market. Unlike the cryptocurrency market, which is quite limited, the NFT market has more potential than we can imagine. So what factors will keep the NFT market on a growth trend?
Before analyzing some of the growth factors of the NFT market, visit immediate-alpha.co and discover a fantastic platform for trading Bitcoin. You don't need anything, registration is free and easy, after this you are ready to go.
One of the reasons the NFT market will continue to grow is its scarcity. NFTs are scarce and this is one of their most important sources of value. NFTs are unique and non-tradeable. For this reason, if you create your NFT, there will never be another like it. Furthermore, unlike cryptocurrencies, which are many, NFTs are very few. All of these factors make NFTs scarce, which has implications for the growth of the market.
In business and investing, scarcity is a good thing. Scarce products or services tend to have higher values. They also tend to be in high demand. Since NFTs are in short supply, they tend to have high values, which is an attractive factor for investors. Who wouldn't want to invest in an asset that has a high value?
NFTs differ from many other asset categories due to their social value. For example, NFTs are not tangible assets. They are representations of possessions in terms of accreditation of ownership. So unlike land, you can buy, view and develop. You can only enjoy the value of NFTs through your digital certificate of ownership.
People are making more than just profits from the NFT market. They also find social connections, fun, and exclusive offers they wouldn't find anywhere else. Many celebrities are now in this space, increasing the social value. Owning NFTs or being part of the marketplace makes many people feel higher levels of social connection and relevance. This is enough for them to continue reaching the market, hence their continued growth.
The NFT market will continue to grow due to its potential opportunities. The market has already provided opportunities for different types of people, including artists and other content creators. Before NFTs, the concept of collecting digital artwork was unimaginable. NFTs are making this a reality.
Humans have yet to explore the opportunities in NFTs. NFT enthusiasts are interested in exploring these hitherto unexplored opportunities. Since NFTs rely on blockchain technology, the potential prospects can only grow. With high expectations for new uses and value, the NFT market will continue to grow.
Despite being an emerging market, the NFT market is increasing and this growth is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Several factors explain this, including the value of NFTs and future potential.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun. However, beyond the entertainment, there are valuable lessons about managing personal finances.

The 3 deposits do not ask for anything, neither payroll nor linked products, you just have to deposit new money into the bank and it gives you:
Furthermore, the investment limits are for all budgets: from €1,000 to €1 million
They are good products, they do not reach the profitability of Facto (up to 4% APR, see here), but it is another option to consider, especially because they are cancelable.
The characteristics of the products are:
Self Bank considers new income, in addition to transfers and income in the bank, the net amounts from the cancellation or maturity of other time deposits contracted with the entity since January 1, 2023.
Of course, as is normal, the bank requires you to have the current account Self Account without commissions:
The current account characteristics are:


Self Bank takes months to make changes to its savings products. We have to go back to the month of October, when I set the profitability of its 4 term deposits that are available to all clients.
This fact contrasts with its activity in the post-summer months and it would not be surprising if it makes changes soon, but it will surely be for the worse.
Self Bank launches another term again, this time for 24 months, but less profitable than the existing ones, at 2.75% APR, which is added to the list of the 3 deposits that the bank had already been offering, which give up to 3 .3% APR.
The lower profitability of the new 2-year deposit is due to the fact that the bank also allows it to be contracted with money that the client already has in the bank, unlike the other 3 that require new money.
Self Bank offers a deposit with a 3-month term and a 3% APR for new money, becoming the most profitable deposit on the market for that term, along with the Facto Account."
225,Wizink lowers its deposits again. Now up to only 2.5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-baja-de-nuevo-sus-depositos-ahora-hasta-solo-25-tae/,02/10/2023,"It is the second consecutive time that Wizink lowers the profitability of its deposits (it already did so in the month of July), and now it pays a maximum of 2.5% APR.
As a novelty, it launches a deposit with a 25-month term and a profitability of 2.3% APR.
Who is going to contract their products, if, for example, Renault Bank offers you a 2.73% APR on a savings account and with the money available?
In fact, its 3% APR was not a stratospheric offer, because there are other entities that exceeded it by more than 1 percentage point such as Haitong (4.22% APR), Facto (4.0% APR), BFS (3. 5% APR) or Pibank (3.34% APR).
Wizink's new offer is:
The characteristics of the products, subject to changes, are:
This offer will be valid until October 31, 2023.
The savings account continues at 1% APR, but it only applies to recently contracted accounts, the old ones that were at 0.5% APR remain unchanged:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

The market is on the rise and will continue to do so, we believe, at least until the end of the year.
Some of the most recent news announced is the increase in rates for Trade Republic and EBN Banco accounts with rates as impressive as 4% APR or 3% APR.
But there will also be expiration of products such as the ING money deposit, and others that have already been renewed ahead of time such as MyInvestor.
Trade Republic will double the profitability of your account up to 4% APR indefinitely and for a maximum of €50,000 for new and existing clients on October 1, 2023.
It will become the most profitable account on the market, and by far, it almost even equals the most profitable deposits.

EBN will increase the profitability of its Remunerated Account from October 1, 2023 to 3% APR, exceeding Renault Bank's 2.73% APR.

EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
227,Evo Banco launches a deposit at 2.85% APR to stop the bank's outflow of liabilities,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/evo-banco-lanza-un-deposito-al-285-tae-para-frenar-la-salida-de-pasivo-del-banco/,28/09/2023,"Evo Banco was the only online bank that closed the month of June with liabilities coming out of its accounts. It lost 90.3 million euros in deposits from January to June, a percentage decrease of 2.4%.
The reason for this departure was logically its uncompetitive offer, which it is now trying to remedy with the launch of a deposit at 2.85% APR and a 12-month term.
The new offer is decent, but far from the best deposits on the market that already exceed 4% APR; but perhaps it will be enough to retain the liabilities, but we do not believe it will capture much.
This product is aimed at both bank clients and new clients and you do not have to join, nor does it require anything to contract it, only the Smart Account without commissions and paid up to 2.5% APR (see here).
The characteristics of this deposit are:
This deposit will be valid until January 31, 2024.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."

But now, it appears that the Contigo Account has gone to 2.73% APR, a small increase of 0.1 percentage points (We think we entered just when the bank was editing its website.)
2 weeks ago the Tu+ Deposit also increased from 3.65% APR to 3.85% APR, after the summer break.
They are minimal and unimportant increases, but the bank is little by little getting closer to the 4% APR of other entities: Haitong and Facto.

As always, the increase applies to both new and current customers and a 2.73% APR with liquid money is very good.

230,…and move my money to Trade Republic at 4% TIN?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/y-mover-mi-dinero-a-trade-republic-al-4-tin/,26/09/2023,"Trade Republic will also increase the profitability of its account from October 1, 2023, but double it, up to 4% annually, as announced on its website and will pay up to €50,000 at that interest rate.
Will it be worth moving money from Renault Bank's Contigo Account to Trade Republic this time? The question could be extended to the rest of the accounts that give much less than Renault Bank.
The answer, from a profitability point of view alone, is a resounding, YES. It will be a 1.4% TIN difference, which if you invest €50,000, the interest difference is very large:
In addition, the features of the Trade Republic account are not bad:
It seems strange to us that a ""broker"" offers these rates for savings. Its function is to earn from commissions on the purchase and sale of securities, not to raise money and lend (traditional banking).
A possible explanation could be that the entity wants to make itself known with this promotion, and attract customers and hope that they invest in its products.
Plus, they don't really lose money on this trade. The money of clients who are liquid, without investing, can be deposited in the ECB and recover that 4%, which is what the ECB pays for bank deposits (deposit facility).
Trade Republic is a foreign entity without a branch in Spain and, therefore, you have:
But really, by not depositing more than €50,000, you forget about model 720 and you only have to declare the interest earned.
Finally, there is a dark point that we are not sure about. As a ""broker"", the account where you put the money is a securities account, different from savings accounts, and, therefore, here, at least, in Spain, the Guarantee Fund that covers this money is the Fund of Investment Guarantee (FOGAIN). They claim that it is €100,000 per client, and yes, that is how it is in Spain.
We also don't like what the following paragraph says, taken from the Trade Republic website.

Who is the depositor of the money, Trade Republic, or each of the clients? Does each client sign custody of the money with the bank?
It is clear that the custodian banks are supervised banks with FGD, but... it says that the money is in a global account.
If it is a single account where all the money is put, then is the depositor Trade Republic? If so, each of Trade Republic's clients are worthless and have no relationship with the Custodian Bank and without coverage from that bank, nor any FGD that is worth it.
If you decide to contract something at Trade Republic, make sure beforehand that the FGD really covers each of the clients.
According to the website www.fgd.es: ""the objective of the FGD is to guarantee the deposits of the clients of the member credit institutions in accordance with the provisions of the regulations."" If you are NOT a J.P. client Morgan SE or Citibank Europe Plc or CitiBank… you do not have deposits in those entities, and therefore, the FGD has no obligations towards you.
The depositor will be Trade Republic, and the FGD will cover Trade Republic, and from what we read, it will only be a single account, so it will only cover €100,000 in full for all clients?
As we say, black point. We have big doubts about this…

231,"It is worth moving €10,000 from Renault Bank (2.63% APR) to EBN (3.00% APR)",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/merece-la-pena-mover-10-000e-de-renault-bank-263-tae-a-ebn-300-tae/,26/09/2023,"As of October 1, 2023, the EBN Banco Remunerated Account will begin to pay 3% APR for the first €10,000 as long as the investment is at least €3,000.
It will surpass Renault Bank's Contigo Account by almost half a point, and many will wonder if it is worth moving money from Renault Bank to EBN Banco.
The answer would be a resounding yes, if EBN had not set that maximum limit of €10,000 to remunerate at 3% APR. But this is not the case, since the interest rate that EBN pays is as follows:
Therefore, moving more than €10,000 from Renault Bank to EBN is foolish; But is it worth moving €10,000? Let's calculate the difference:
That is, by making that move, you would obtain €37 gross (€30 net) more per year, or in other words, €2.5 net more per month.
Is it worth it to you? It's not a lot of money. If you are not an EBN client, well, I would directly say NO.
But if you already have EBN, then for a few mouse clicks, you can earn €2.5 every month (a free beer or coffee), well, it may be worth it. And you? Leave us a comment.

EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.

In this case, a deposit at 3% APR and a 12-month term.
This product, the bank, is sent to its clients via email, at least that is how we as clients have received it. And of course, we wanted to know how ""exclusive"" the offer was.
…And, we were left with our eyes wide open. It is a worse offer than the one in August that was offered at 3.25% APR (see here).
If we compare it with its generalized offer, it is the same profitability, at 3% APR, but instead of 6 months, it is a 12-month term. What exclusivity!
Furthermore, to obtain this return you must direct deposit a payroll, pension, unemployment benefit or monthly income of at least €600 for at least 10 months. Otherwise, it is remunerated at 2% APR, like the general offer.
In order to contract this deposit, you must bring new money to the bank that represents an increase in your balance in Openbank compared to that of February 28, 2023.
The characteristics of this deposit are:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""

233,"Can I get a 4% APR deposit? Yes, we tell you where.",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/puedo-conseguir-una-rentabilidad-del-4-tae-si-te-decimos-donde/,25/09/2023,"With the interest rate at 4.5% in the Euro Zone, the Euribor at more than 4% and above all, the deposit facility, what the ECB pays to the banks that park their money there, is at 4 %; We would all think that it would be relatively easy to find deposits or accounts at 4% APR.
Well, the harsh reality of Spain is that this is not the case, unlike other Euro countries. Here to find a 4% APR you must go to small entities, very recently created and of course, online banks, and none based in Spain.
Unfortunately, and this is what the banks count on, it is that in Spain it is difficult for people to move their money. An example is that ING is the bank that captures the most money and has the most funds from savers, but its offer is not even one of the best, rather mediocre (See here).
From here we encourage you to move your money and it is the way that will cause you to have to pay more to receive our money.
Having said all this, yes, you can find a handful of offers that give 4% APR for our money, the same as what the ECB pays to the banks:
They are banks that communicate your data to the Tax Agency, applying personal income tax withholdings. For all intents and purposes it is as if it were a Spanish bank, with the exception that the FGD is foreign.
Haitong is an entity that markets its products in Raisin, but has a branch in Spain, offering deposits of up to 4.22% APR:
The 12-month deposit is the one we like the most, at 4.1% APR. The FGD that covers the deposits is the Portuguese one.
>> See more details of the offer
Facto offers terms from 6 months to 15 months at 4% TIN (just over 4% APR). The good thing about their products is that they reach 4% APR in just 6 months.
The evolution of Facto rates is a true reflection of how rates in Europe have evolved, but not what most banks give to savers:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD.
>> See more details of the offer
They are foreign entities, unrelated to the Treasury. You will have to declare the interest on your own and if you exceed a total of more than €50,000 in these entities, you will have to file form 720.
However, you could get a little more bang for your buck.
On the Raisin platform there are up to 9 banks that offer rates of 4% APR or more. It is a clear example that in Europe they pay more for savers' money.
Of all of them, we already highlighted the Haitong offer that has a branch in Spain, and here we will review 2 of its most profitable offers: Banca Sistema and SME Bank.
Banca Sistema offers its deposits through Raisin, with a profitability of up to 4.4% APR and a 1-year term.
It has longer terms, but also less profitable, and of course, less interesting:
The FGD guarantee is Italian.
Recently associated with Raisin, it offers the same interest rate as Banca Sistema, at 4.4% APR for 12 months.
But their offer is slightly better, because they offer more than 4% APR from the 6-month term:
The FGD is from Lithuania
Trade Republic will double the profitability of your account up to 4% APR for an indefinite period in the month of October and for a maximum of €50,000 for new and existing clients.
It will become the most profitable account on the market, by far. This offer is somewhat strange since it comes from a broker that removes money without investing at that interest rate.
The FGD is German.
>> See more detail here


On the Raisin platform there are more than 20 bank deposits that offer a profitability of at least 4% APR, reaching up to 4.4% APR. Are they worth it?
In the last year, the profitability of deposits has only gone up and up. Right now we can find 3% deposits without problems, and there are offers that have reached 4% APR and even more.
But what is the best deposit? The answer is not simple, it depends.
Banca Sistema increases the profitability of its term deposits contractable through Raisin, up to 1.41% APR.
Also, if you are a new Raisin customer, you can get €150 bonus: €100 welcome and €50 for the friend plan."

SME Bank is a Lithuanian entity, and under the Lithuanian Deposit Guarantee Fund, which protects €100,000 per client and offers 4 fixed terms from 6 months to 2 years:
The characteristics of this deposit are:
The opening request, as well as the renewal of the term deposit, will be carried out 100% online.
Banca Sistema also offers 4.4% APR for 1 year term, but being an Italian bank and the money would be protected by the FGD of Italy.
The rest of the terms of this entity are of longer term and lower profitability. So they are not worth it.
Speaking of Raisin, we must always mention Haitong, branch in Spain.
This entity offers a deposit at 4.1% APR for 12 months, only a little less profitable than the other 2, but it has the advantage of having a presence in Spain.
This bank makes personal income tax withholdings and communicates your data to the Treasury, and you forget about the hassle of the 720 form that in certain situations you would have to do in the other 2 banks.
>> See details of Haitong's offer


With the interest rate at 4.5% in the Euro Zone, the Euribor at more than 4% and above all, the ECB's deposit facility, what the central bank pays to the banks that park their money there, is in 4%; We would all think that it would be relatively easy to find deposits or accounts at 4% APR.
But reality is not like that. Yes, there are offers at 4% APR, but they are from foreign entities, some with a branch in Spain and of course, they are small and/or newly created and all online."
235,Ranking of online banks that captured the most deposits in the first half: ING sweeps,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ranking-bancos-online-que-mas-depositos-captaron-en-el-primer-semestre-ing-arrasa/,21/09/2023,"ING is the online bank that has captured the most deposits, and by far, during the first half of 2023 (3,348 million), according to data from the Bank of Spain.
In fact, it is the online bank with the most money on deposit from savers and with a very large margin. Do you understand now why ING does not increase its deposits more?
The Dutch entity started the year with its 2 deposits with 12 and 18 month terms at 0.6 and 0.85% APR and its account at 0.5% APR and 0.7% APR if you have a payroll, and it ended in June , at 1.3 and 1.5% APR for your deposits and the account at 0.85% APR and 1.25% APR with payroll.
Also note that before the end of June, the bank launched a promotion to attract new money for 3 months and at 2.5% APR.
Thus, ING went from charging clients commissions for having more than €30,000 in the Orange account if they did not have the payroll account until November 1, 2022 to remunerating your money in the account or offering you a deposit at 2.5% APR in June 2023.
So, in principle, the fact that ING has raised more money could be understood in a certain way by how its offer evolved.
But what is not understood is that at the beginning of 2023 there were 44 billion euros in ING. Nor is it understood that it has raised more than 4 times more than the next one on the list, which is MyInvestor (796 million).
How is it possible that it captures more than other entities that at the beginning of the year, such as Facto, offered 2% APR for 3 months or Renault Bank at more than 1% APR for its account and more than 2% APR for its deposit or MyInvestor at 2% APR on your account? ING gave a quarter.
Furthermore, the evolution of ING's competition was much more aggressive. In March, for example, Wizink already offered 3% APR on its deposits, in June Haitong already offered 4% APR and Renault Bank 2.25% APR for its account and 3.65% APR for its deposit.
Are you one of those who trust your money to ING or perhaps you have preferred other banks? Leave us a comment below.
The second online entity with the most deposits is Openbank, but like ING it is not because its offer is the best.


BBVA, Santander and Caixa Bank have almost half of the balance of all deposits in Spain at the end of the first half of 2015 according to sources from AEB, CECA and Bank of Spain.
Banco Caixa Geral has eliminated from its deposit portfolio the 2 most profitable fixed terms that it had been marketing.
These are your deposits with a 24 and 27 month term at 2.25% APR.
If in 2013 it was one of the most active entities in the liabilities war, if this year it wants to maintain the level it will have to improve its offer.
Moody's affirms that Spanish banks will continue to need liquidity.
He also says that the BdE limits will not significantly impact what investors decide."

The bank will limit the amount of money to be paid at 3% APR to a maximum of €10,000, compared to the current €50,000. We believe too little:
The characteristics of your account are:
NOTE: If you put, for example, €60,000 in the bank: the first €10,000 is remunerated at 3% APR; The next €40,000 is remunerated at 1.5% APR and the rest (€10,000 is not remunerated).
This account is without commissions, without demands. It is a savings account so it does not accept direct debits, debits, or payment operations using credit or debit cards.
The increase to 3.5% APR is dwarfed by the increase in your account. But it is still useful, for amounts that exceed the limit paid at 3% APR on your account.
The changes made by the bank are actually 2:
Thus, it leaves aside the offer of the summer months in which clients received extra profitability in some fixed terms.

From successor of the Orange Account to nothing,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/adios-a-la-cuenta-de-ahorro-de-nn-bank-nnespana-sucesor-de-la-cuenta-naranja-a-nada/,19/09/2023,"NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
In 2018, when ING did not give anything, NN Bank offered 0.3% APR on its account (see here), and while the rest of the banks continued to lower the remuneration of their accounts, and even charged for our money, NN Bank offered 0.5% APR (see here), and even had a friendly plan in the style of its ""partner"", ING, offering a welcome bonus of €20.
In fact, it was one of the most profitable accounts for months (see here), but with the rise in the price of money in the Euro Zone, NN Spain was left behind.
A little less than 1 year ago we wondered what was happening to the bank (see here), since the rest of the banks raised rates, NN Bank did not react.
Months later, in May, the bank posted a sign stating that the savings account cannot be contracted temporarily (see here).
Today, September 19, 2023, the bank is sending its clients that it will close the account in 2 months, on November 20.
It will be the end of the history of an entity related to ING (years ago the insurer, Nationale Netherlanden, were the only offices of ING), with whom it went hand in hand for a long time, it will have had a short-lived adventure in the world of savers .
>> See list of news about NN Bank

NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account.
In 2018 we welcomed NN Bank as a possible successor to ING by offering profitability on the accounts as much as ING charged for storing its clients' money.
But in 2022, things have changed, even ING has returned to profitability in its account, but NN Bank continues without making any changes, it remains at its 0.2% APR. To return to?"
239,How to determine the value of an NFT before purchasing,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/como-determinar-el-valor-de-un-nft-antes-de-comprar/,19/09/2023,"Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are still new and few people understand them. For this reason, it is even more difficult to determine whether you should invest in them. However, for those already familiar with NFTs, they can be a great profitable investment. Some entities have made millions of dollars selling NFTs.
NFTs are gaining popularity as an attractive investment option. Now more and more people are willing to invest in NFTs due to the perception that they have a high value. But how do you decide which NFT to buy? Of course, the value of the NFT must be considered as one of the criteria. So how do you determine this value?
Before we focus on how you can determine the value of an NFT before purchasing it, perhaps the first thing to consider is the reason for purchasing the NFT. For most investors, the high monetary value of NFTs is the reason for purchasing. But NFTs have other non-monetary uses, including gaming or gaining exclusive access to communities or events.
So after understanding what specific value you are looking for in the NFT, you may be in a better position to determine its value. However, just like the crypto market, NFTs are very volatile and prices can change without notice. A good investor must understand all these important factors.
Speaking of good investors, you should try the Granimator app, an excellent online trading platform that will expand your investment portfolio, experience and profits. Signing up is free and takes just a few minutes. Then, you can combine your investing skills with the platform's unique functionalities to maximize your profits.
NFTs are often only as good as those behind them, including the creators, buyers, and partners. Typically, the people behind NFTs will influence their value by triggering speculation. Celebrities and people of higher social standing tend to own or associate with high-value NFTs. Therefore, you should do your research to understand those behind the NFT before purchasing.
Also, consider how rare the NFT is before purchasing. Always choose very rare NFTs because they tend to have higher values. The rarity may depend on who made or owns the NFT. For example, some celebrities or respected NFT creators will have high-value NFTs. This is common knowledge even in a business where rare items like gold are more precious.
A smart investor would never invest in anything that has no particular use. You are purchasing the NFT expecting to gain certain benefits from it. NFTs can have different purposes. Some can only be used as unique digital certificates to prove ownership of a real asset. However, some NFTs can be used to earn usage fees. For example, a short tokenized music clip can earn you some money every time someone plays it.
Liquidity refers to the ease with which you can buy or sell something. Even with NFTs, you have to consider liquidity to evaluate its value. Typically, NFTs that are easy to trade tend to have a higher value than those that are harder to trade. Fortunately, most NFTs are easily transferable.
With their increasing popularity recently, NFTs are becoming an attractive investment option for many investors. But even if you like them a lot, it is wise to always consider a few things before deciding to buy a particular NFT.

240,How Bitcoin technology could improve transparency in supply chains,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/como-la-tecnologia-bitcoin-podria-mejorar-la-transparencia-en-las-cadenas-de-suministro/,19/09/2023,"Bitcoin has an underlying technology and built-in infrastructure known as blockchain technology. This blockchain is a distributed public ledger that contains transaction records and is managed by thousands of computing nodes. It is quite difficult to manipulate or interfere with blockchain technology. Any suggested change to blockchain technology requires the support of 51% of computing nodes. Therefore, it is quite difficult to propose changes to the blockchain.
Bitcoin was the first currency to popularize blockchain technology and now other companies are applying this technology. Companies can use blockchain technology to track any transaction, allowing the sharing of documents, personal information, and this same electronic currency. Blockchain is distributed across the network, therefore, it is difficult to corrupt.
The product of each commercial establishment that reaches an end user represents the collective effort of many organizations and stakeholders, collectively referred to as the supply chain. Organizations within a supply chain are linked through physical and information flows. On the one hand, physical flows involve the transformation, movement and storage of goods and materials. On the other hand, information flows involve coordination between partners to control the daily flow of goods up and down the supply chain and involve long-term planning.
Likewise, managing the sourcing of products or materials, procurement, production and logistics of raw materials, products and finished goods from one point to another is called supply chain management. With effective supply management, people can minimize costs and production speed will increase with risks mitigated.
Supply chains have been suffering greatly from a lack of transparency. Companies that apply blockchain technology can use it to track all types of transactions securely and transparently.
Here's how Bitcoin technology could improve transparency in supply chains.
Blockchain technology is decentralized and allows peer-to-peer transactions. In this way, companies can use blockchain technology, which is more efficient, as it will allow them to complete transactions directly without intermediaries. The absence of intermediaries ensures that transactions are fast and less expensive. This blockchain technology also enables the integration of financial and logistics services, enabling better data partnerships between stakeholders.
An integrated payment solution helps minimize the time between ordering and processing a payment, ensuring proper and timely movement of products. Additionally, blockchain and smart contracts help companies improve compliance, reduce legal fees and penalties for late payment of taxes. Therefore, blockchain technology helps promote greater efficiency in the supply chain.
No one can delete blockchain records and transactions as they are permanent. Furthermore, blockchain is a publicly distributed ledger, therefore, it is very transparent and transactions can be accessed by all blockchain users. This transparency of blockchain technology leads to an excellent supply chain. Likewise, every step in the supply chain is securely recorded, meaning everyone can easily trace logistics issues back to their source.
For example, if a construction project is carried out, the contractor can know the output of his construction components or raw materials from their origin. The ability to track products helps increase accountability and transparency, it also prevents illegal activities.
Organizations and businesses should consider their industries, relevant regulations, code of ethics, suppliers, and desired level of risk to determine the right level of supply chain transparency. Together, organizations can trade, buy or sell Bitcoins through the Bitcoin Billionaire app. Blockchain technology will help reduce system inefficiencies, for example, when suppliers try in vain to connect the dots based on what they need, when and how or any other common problems.
Many companies are integrating blockchain technology into their operations due to its transparency and efficiency. In this way, blockchain technology can help improve transparency in the supply chain.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun.

241,"Trade Republic will double the profitability of your account in October, up to 4% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/trade-republic-doblara-la-rentabilidad-de-su-cuenta-en-octubre-hasta-el-4-tae/,18/09/2023,"Trade Republic will double the profitability of your account up to 4% APR indefinitely and for a maximum of €50,000 for new and existing clients in October.
It will become the most profitable account on the market, and by far, it almost even equals the most profitable deposits.
This is a direct consequence of the increase in interest rates to 4.5% in the euro zone, according to the entity.
The characteristics of this account are:
How does an investment entity give so much interest for your liquid money? We already said on a previous occasion, we don't understand this offer very well, but it makes some sense.
Their business is a broker that allows you to invest in different products. Thus, its function is not to raise money and lend, but to collect commissions from the purchase/sale of shares, securities...
A possible explanation could be that the entity wants to make itself known with this promotion, and attract customers and hope that they invest in its products.
Either way, they don't really lose money on this trade. The money of clients who are liquid, without investing, can be deposited in the ECB and recover that 4%, which is what the ECB pays for bank deposits (deposit facility).
It really only transfers what the ECB pays to the clients, and in the process it attracts clients, and hopes to make money with them if they invest in any of the products it offers.
It is defined as a German securities institution, supervised by the German Federal Bank and BaFin and has been operating in Spain since October 2021.
It says that the money is under the deposit guarantee system (SGD), specifically, that of Citibank Europe plc (see here), a German entity and the German Fund, which is the depositary entity of the cash.
It defines SGD as insurance for the money you have in your cash account. In the event of insolvency, your Trade Republic cash balance is protected up to €100,000 by legal deposit protection, anywhere in Europe.
We are not sure if they are talking about FGD (Deposit Guarantee Fund) or FOGAIN (Investment Guarantee Fund), but for all intents and purposes it is the same.


Trade Republic has obtained a complete banking record from the ECB, so it will be able to start trading and bank deposits throughout the euro zone.
Its star product in Spain is its securities account, which pays 4% annually for uninvested cash and up to a maximum of €50,000.
and yes, €100,000 per person is guaranteed.
The beginning of October will come with some quite important news: rate increases on some accounts, expiration and/or renewal of offers. The market is on the rise and will continue to do so, we believe, at least until the end of the year.
Some of the most recent news announced are the increase in rates and other offers will expire their marketing period... they will renew it. We tell you
Trade Republic will also increase the profitability of its account from October 1, 2023, but double it, up to 4% annually, as announced on its website and will pay up to €50,000 at that interest rate.
Will it be worth moving money from Renault Bank's Contigo Account to Trade Republic this time? The question could be extended to the rest of the accounts that give much less than Renault Bank."
242,"ECB pays the banks for our money at 4%, and the banks us?",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bce-paga-a-los-bancos-por-su-dinero-al-4-y-los-bancos-nosotros/,15/09/2023,"Where are those bankers who in times of negative rates came out vehemently saying that if the ECB charges them for putting money in the central bank, they should pass those costs on to clients (see here)
In fact, ING was one of the banks that did it and charged at least 14,000 clients for having €30,000 or more in the Orange account and who did not have the payroll account, which will be more because the data we have is February 2022 (see here) and the bank continued with the policy of collecting until the end of October 2022.
Well, now the situation is completely the opposite. Yesterday the ECB raised the interest rate for the tenth consecutive time, up to 4.5%, and the deposit facility, which pays banks to park their money at the ECB, by 4%.
That is, your money that is in the bank, and the bank has not invested it elsewhere, puts it in the ECB, and earns 4%.
Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank among others, are real crooks who pocket millions of euros with your savings without doing anything and don't give you a single cent in return.
Luckily there are some entities that do offer something for your money, but not really enough.
If the bank transferred what they are paid by the ECB as is, it would have to offer a Savings Account with total liquidity at 4%; but currently, the most profitable account is not even close to 3% APR:
Everyone else doesn't even reach 2% APR, so they earn more than what they pay you, and the money is yours.
And if we go to deposits, which should pay more, since they do not have liquidity, there are not many that exceed 3%:
Only 2 entities exceed what the ECB pays them: Haitong and Facto. The rest all take money without doing anything. What a shame!
NOTE: All the entities mentioned have a branch in Spain, although it may be under the foreign FGD. We have not considered foreign banks whose products can be contracted in Spain.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
243,"Pichincha increases the profitability of its account and deposit, but remains behind Pibank",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/pichincha-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-su-cuenta-y-deposito-pero-sigue-detras-de-pibank/,14/09/2023,"Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
Specifically, the entity has raised the Remunerated account from 1% APR to 1.51% APR, half a point of what Pibank gives: 2.02% APR.
A similar difference has been found in the 12-month deposit, which has risen from 2% APR to 2.75% APR, compared to Pibank's 3.34% APR.
The strategy of the entity that prefers to redirect all its clientele to the online office is clear, since among other things, the bank has very few offices and reserves them more for remittances from Ecuadorian citizens who work in Spain.
There are only 12 offices with a presence in only 6 Spanish cities: Alicante, Barcelona, ​​Madrid, Murcia, Valencia and Zaragoza.
With the increase, Banco Pichincha begins to remunerate your liquid money at 1.51% APR, as we already said, half a point less than Pibank, which is giving at 2.02% APR.
The rest of the features are the same:
The increase in the 12-month deposit has been greater, from 2% APR to 2.75% APR and leaves it, like the Pibank account at half a point: 3.34% APR.
The rest all the same:
The bank has not established a marketing period for these products.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Pibank is only the online office of Banco Pichincha. For all intents and purposes it is the same bank, with the peculiarity that you must operate online.
What do you prefer? A few offices or more profitability in your savings products?"
244,"Notice: Revolut branch in Spain, but your account at 3.7% APR is not a bank account",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/nuevo-aviso-revolut-sucursal-en-espana-pero-su-cuenta-al-34-tae-no-es-una-cuenta-bancaria/,13/09/2023,"Today you can read in the press that Revolut has reached 2 million customers in Spain and in addition, all new customers are being given a Spanish IBAN, since the bank has obtained a banking file in our country and will function as a branch of its Lithuanian parent company.
Old clients will also be gradually migrated to Spanish IBAN. Of course, the FGD is Lithuanian, but it covers, like the Spanish one, €100,000 per person.
By having a branch in Spain, the entity will allow you to carry out Bizum, receive direct debits of receipts or payrolls, pay taxes, etc.
So, all good and good news for customers, but be careful! The product that catches the attention of most savers is its “Flexible Account.”
If you go to their website, on the cover you can read: «Increase your savings with up to 3.7% savings«, which together with the news of the Spanish IBAN, many of you will say: «come on..., it seems interesting«.
It only seems that way, because at first glance we believe that it is a bank account, but the Flexible Account is NOT. It is like an account linked to investment funds or some variable asset, with the characteristic that it has very high liquidity.
That 3.7% APR is as of August 16, 2023; It is surely the day that gave the highest profitability.
The bank itself warns you that it is ""subject to daily changes."" ""Its growth is not guaranteed and capital is subject to risk.""
So, our conclusion is that you forget about this topic, unless you are investors, and not savers to whom we usually direct our publications.
You can read all the information about the risks that the bank itself has linked in this product (see here).

As the bank explains, the Revolut account “is a payment account and we consider the money you deposit in it a deposit. These types of accounts are often called “checking accounts,” a type of bank account where you can deposit and withdraw money and make payments.
Furthermore, as the entity has a branch in Spain, you will have an account with a Spanish IBAN (personal income tax withholdings and communication to the Treasury of your data. There is no need for form 720) and under the supervision of the Bank of Spain:
Everything is correct, BUT, the Revolut Account does not offer any profitability.


The profitability of the Revolut Flexible Account reached up to 3.97% as of January 15, 2024, which the entity announces on its website.
That almost 4% APR, which you add to the ""account"" that ""pays interest daily"" and ""withdraw funds when you need it"", makes many not resist the temptation.
More than 350 million euros has been captured by Revolut in its Flexible Account among Spanish savers according to a press release issued by the bank itself.
There are 350 million euros invested in a monetary fund that people do not know and think is a traditional account.
We made it clear in our previous post that the 3.4% Revolut account is NOT a bank account and not covered by the FGD. It is an investment product, more specifically a Monetary Fund.
We explain the risks."
245,Renault Bank raises the 2-year You Deposit to 3.85% APR. The account unchanged,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-sube-hasta-385-tae-el-deposito-tu-a-2-anos-la-cuenta-sin-cambios/,13/09/2023,"Renault Bank slightly increases the profitability of its 24-month deposit, the Tú Deposit, to 3.85% APR, from 3.65% APR.
It is an increase of 0.2 percentage points after more than 1 month without changes, and it falls behind the 2 entities that offer the 4% APR: Haitong and Facto.
This change is not yet reflected on the entity's website at the time of publication of this article, but it is in a PDF of ""RATES, COMMISSIONS AND REPRESENTABLE EXPENSES"" of these products. See here.
The Contigo Account continues at 2.63% APR. This interest rate has been in force since June; However, this product remains the most interesting.
The deposit, much more profitable, but the term is too long for a non-cancellable product, and that is a drawback currently with the prospect of more increases.

Offer valid until September 26, 2023.
Offer valid until September 26, 2023.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.

246,Wizink no longer has losses like in recent years. Risks? Interesting in your deposits?,https://www.tucapital.es/bancos/fgd-fondo-de-garantia-de-depositos/wizink-ya-no-tiene-perdidas-como-los-ultimos-anos/,12/09/2023,"Wizink finally makes a profit after several years in a row of losses. He earned €53,000 net in the first quarter of this year, according to the accounts released by the financial institution.
In recent years, the entity's results were not very good, always with losses:
However, all these losses are due to the fact that the bank made provisions in order to strengthen its balance sheet or to cover possible litigation over revolving cards.
Thus, in 2022 it supplied 29 million euros, in 2021 with 213.3 million euros, in 2020 61 million or in 2019 with 209 million.
Wizink has been in the hole of revolving cards for years, and hence his losses. If we take that fact out of the equation, the bank has made profits.
On the other hand, as you all know, the money in Wizink is guaranteed by the Spanish FGD. If it goes bankrupt, each client will receive up to €100,000 from the FGD.
Furthermore, since it is a small entity, there would be no problems for the FGD to cover all the clients' money. We have a precedent: the Bank of Madrid (see here).
The larger an entity, the worse for the FGD. In those cases, the problem is resolved through other means, such as that of Banco Popular, which was sold for €1 to Santander, and the FGD did not have to intervene.
In short, we do not believe that we run the risk by putting money in this entity, and even less so now that it already has net benefits.
We leave you the link to some interesting articles on these topics:
That is another issue. Winzik currently offers a savings account at 1% APR, and 3 deposits of up to 3% APR:
In the market there are accounts with up to 2.63% APR such as Renault Bank or 2.02% APR from Pibank and deposits with more suitable terms and/or much higher profitability.
The most profitable offers on the market reach up to 4% APR, in terms of 3, 6 or 12 months (Haitong, Facto, Banco BIG, BFS, Pibank...).
In conclusion. Wizink deposits and its savings account do remunerate your money unlike large banks, but they are not the most profitable on the market.
...and what do you think? Leave us a comment below.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

It has been a slight increase from the 2.75% APR.
Is this a good deposit? Is it a good interest rate? What other similar offers are there? The answer is: yes, yes and yes, but few.
A short-term fixed term is good if you think that rates will continue to rise and from what we are seeing month after month, it seems that it will continue to do so.
Furthermore, 3 months is very good, since it would end in the month of December, and the bank has the habit of wanting to reach the balance of its accounts with each quarter closing and even more so with the annual closing.
As for the interest rate, 2.9% APR, it is one of the highest for that term. Although there are more profitable deposits that reach up to 4% APR, but they would be longer term: 6, 12 months or more (Haitong, Facto, Banco BIG, BFS...).
With a 3-month term, there are not many offers with that profitability:
There is another option, the Renault Bank paid account, liquid money and at a not so distant interest rate: 2.63% APR. Also, in 2 days we will have news about this bank, hopefully there will be an increase.
In short: it has a good term, good profitability, but there are also other offers to take into account. It is one more of the good options. What do you think?

In order to contract these deposits, of course, you must have an account with the following characteristics:

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
248,The “Come to Arquia Deposit” gives you 4% APR for 6 months with a BIG BUT,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/el-deposito-ven-a-arquia-te-da-un-4-tae-durante-6-meses-con-un-gran-pero/,11/09/2023,"Arquia offers a 6-month deposit and a 4% APR for new clients and with the possibility of early cancellation.
Anyone who reads that will say that these are 3 very interesting features for a fixed term currently, and the others are not bad either:
The topic is the big BUT with which we titled the post. The entity requires compliance with one of the following obligations:
These links must be met in the month prior to expiration, and if not, the deposit would be paid at 1% APR, normal, downwards.
As this is an offer only for new customers, existing customers who meet the conditions cannot take advantage of the offer. So whoever wants the 4% APR deposit will necessarily have to make a new connection with the bank.
This offer will be valid until September 30, 2023.


Arquia has reduced its 6-month deposit for new clients registered from January 1, 2024 by half a point, to 3.5% APR.
It has also modified the maximum investment limit, rising from €30,000 to €50,000. In this way, the final reward is greater, but at the expense of having to invest more money.
Arquia continues to offer its deposit for a 6-month term and at 4% APR for new clients and with the possibility of early cancellation during the month of October.
The characteristics of this deposit, called “Ven a Arquia deposit” are quite interesting. The bad thing requires connections.
2021 will be the third year that Arquia commits the mistake of not allowing its clients to freely close their accounts due to actions by the entity.
The bad thing is that they charge €50 per year in commission for an account that they want to close and they won't let them."

It is nothing extraordinary, since if we compare it with the best offers, it is half of what they offer and it also comes with a catch.
The profitability is not just 2% APR, it only gives you 1% APR, and if you want the 2% APR you have to join:

But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year.
CaixaBank will give Bankia's online customers a good blow by requiring them to comply with the Day by Day program to be exempt from commissions (up to €240 per year).

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
251,"EBN extended its summer offer for 1 week, up to 3.2% APR. Will there be new deposits?",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-prorrogo-por-1-semana-su-oferta-de-verano-hasta-el-32-tae-habra-nuevos-depositos/,07/09/2023,"EBN Banco during the summer (July and August) has offered some of its deposits with extra rates for clients and new clients, whose validity expired on August 31, 2023.
However, the entity has extended it for 1 week, until September 8, 2023. This short-term extension suggests that there will be news or at least they are thinking about it.
As far as we know, the bank has been sending mailings since yesterday to potential clients who were interested in its products one day. Although the offer is the same as what appears on their website and for shorter terms:
We see that the bank is showing interest, but will it go up? Will you extend it? Or will the previous guys come back? We'll see what happens after day 8.
EBN at the beginning of July offered clients extra rates on deposits of 4, 6, 9 and 12 months.
Later, it also offered 2 of those deposits with an extra rate to new customers. Those with 9 and 12 month terms.
Thus, their current offer until September 8 is:
The rest of the features are:
The characteristics of your account are as follows:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

In addition, it links the profitability of these last 2 fixed terms depending on the amount invested: more than €50,000 or less.
The product will have a 4-month term (the summer offer was 3 months) and at 2.75% APR, improving the previous offer of 2.5% APR.
This deposit can be contracted by clients and new clients who make deposits from September 6 to 30.
This product allows early cancellation, in which case, the interest rate you will receive will be 1.36% TIN (1.37% APR) for the days in which the canceled amount has been kept in the deposit.
The characteristics of this product are:
This offer will be available until September 30, 2023.
As we have said, ING rewards those who invest the most money in the bank (€50,000), and compared to what it offered it is a considerable increase.
Until now it offered a 1.3% APR for 12 months and 1.5% APR for 18 months, which has increased to 2% APR for 12 months and 2.25% APR for 18 months:
1. Term of 12 months:
2. Term of 18 months
This offer will be available until September 30, 2023.
Without changes:


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

Its 2 welcome deposits at 4% and 3.5% APR at 6 and 3 months were very successful, and we believe that these too, and it has the advantage that it is for everyone: New or old clients.
They are not at the levels of Haitong or Facto, but they are the third on the list of the most profitable and have the advantage that they are cancelable, unlike the other 2.
This entity offers a third deposit, but not very interesting, for 3 months and at 2.25% APR:
The characteristics of these deposits are:
Big offers the “Big Account”, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.

Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

257,Orange Bank offers from today 2% APR on your savings account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-ofrece-desde-hoy-2-tae-en-su-cuenta-de-ahorro/,01/09/2023,"After more than 1 month of waiting, finally, the Orange Bank account is at 2% APR. It was an increase announced on July 25, 2023 and comes into effect today.
With so much waiting time, it has allowed other entities such as Pibank to react accordingly, and the launch of other offers, such as Facto, totally eclipses its marketing effect. Furthermore, every time he has done it, customers have been quite annoyed: ""If he wants to upload, upload him already.""
The increase is 0.2 percentage points for Orange customers and Former customers, from 1.8% APR to 2% APR; and 0.3% percentage points for Non-Orange customers, from 1.5% APR to 1.8% APR.
This 2.0% APR will only be for customers with an Orange line, and those who signed up for the account before December 19, 2022.
Thus, the profitability of this account will be as follows:
The rest of the features remain unchanged:
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.
On December 19, Orange Bank allows you to open an account without the need for an Orange mobile line. But these customers will receive 0.8% APR instead of 1% APR. Former customers maintain the 1% APR.
On March 1, the bank raised it to 1.5% (Orange clients) and 1.3% APR (without Orange line).
On June 1, it reached 1.8% and 1.5% APR, and in just over 1 month, up to 2% and 1.8% APR.
A few days ago, Orange, the company on which Orange Bank depends, announced that it wants to sell the banking entity.
It has entered into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas, which already has Banco Cetelem in Spain.
For many, it is even good news, because Orange scares many many people. The bad thing is the uncertainty of BNP's commercial strategy that it will apply to Orange Bank clients.
Nothing should worry the bank's 200,000 clients at the moment. We have had similar cases and we have told them on this website such as that of Ibanesto, Oficina Directa or COINC.

Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."

This offer will be for all clients of the entity, unlike Orange Bank, which will only be for old or new clients, as long as they are also a client of the Orange mobile company (see Orange Bank offer here).
It was an increase that was already desired, the bank has not updated the rates of this product since April, but the wait has been worth it. It will be an increase of half a percentage point, from 1.51% APR to 2.02% APR.
Despite the increase, it remains behind Renault Bank, which offers a 2.63% APR.
The characteristics of the Remunerated Account are:
Pibank offers a 1-year deposit and a 3.3% APR. This profitability was set in the month of June and we believe that it will not take long to update it:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."

This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has notified us of this (NOTE: They have already updated the Raisin website).
The most striking thing about this increase is that it rises from 0.15% APR to 4.11% APR. A full-fledged rise and it becomes one of the most interesting deposits in Raisin.
Another entity that offers a good interest rate for that term in Raisin is Haitong (3.81%), with the advantage that it has a branch in Spain.
But if we have to choose, we are left with Facto, which now offers 4.06% at 6 months, and you do not have Raisin as an intermediary with a branch in Spain.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
>> See more details of the deposit
The entity offers terms from 3 months to 3 years, with the same characteristics of the aforementioned deposit, and whose returns are:
BluOr is a foreign entity, so you have the following drawbacks:
Raisin only intervenes as an intermediary to help you arrange the deposit with a communication channel in Spanish.
BluOr Bank AS (BluOr Bank as a trading name) was founded in 2001 and is headquartered in Riga, the capital of Latvia.
It is the fifth largest bank in Latvia in terms of assets under management and focuses on modern, user-friendly banking combined with individual service. BluOr Bank's goal is to be the first to respond to changes in the international business world to offer its clients the most effective and advanced banking products. The bank has subsidiaries in Estonia, as well as in Moscow, London and Limassol (Cyprus).
The Bank's main clients are companies engaged in international trade or that act as holding companies. BluOr Bank has strong capital reserves, with Tier 1 core capital of 13.23% and a total capital ratio of 15.37% (as of December 31, 2019).
The increase in capital requirements for European banks (Basel III) requires banks to have a capital buffer of at least 8%, which means that BluOr Bank is well above what is required.
The Latvian Deposit Guarantee Fund guarantees the equivalent of 100,000 euros per client.


BluOr Bank AS, a Latvian entity, which offers deposit via Raisin, has increased the profitability of its 1-year deposit from 3.45% APR to 3.80% APR.
It keeps the rest of your deposits unchanged giving a maximum of 4% APR over a fixed term of 6 months.
BlueOrange Bank also increases the profitability of its deposits, in this way, there are already 3 banks (Wizink and Facto) that have applied an increase in the profitability of their products in the month of April.
BlueOrange Bank is a Latvian entity that offers its deposits through Raisn, which are now remunerated up to 1.16% APR.
BlueOrange Bank, a Latvian entity, offers deposits through Raisn, raising its 12-month deposit to 1.22% APR.
The increase is very slight, from 1.15% APR to 1.22% APR, just enough to surpass Haitong's 1.17% APR and become the most profitable 1-year deposit offered through this platform."

Which one would you choose to hire?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/cual-es-el-deposito-mas-rentable-que-existe-actualmente/,30/08/2023,"In the last year, the profitability of deposits has only gone up and up. Right now we can find 3% deposits without problems, and there are offers that have reached 4% APR and even more.
This bullish rally began in August 2022, and Facto was precisely one of the banks that started this rate hike.
It was then, (see here) when we wrote an article and said ""wow"" about the rise in Facto to 2.25% APR for the terms that the bank offers right now, 4.06% APR.
Having said all this, what is the most profitable deposit currently? The answer is not just 1 deposit, there will be some parameters to take into account
In absolute terms, and among the deposits that are on our radar, we have a deposit at 4.4% APR, and it is offered by Banca Sistema through the Raisin platform.
In addition, it offers it for a not excessively long term, 1 year, with interest payment at maturity.
The investment limits are not very demanding: between €20,000 and €100,000.
In addition to the drawback that it is not cancelable, it is a deposit in a foreign entity (Italy), without a branch in Spain and generates 2 inconveniences:
>> See deposit details
The most profitable is held by another entity that offers its products in Raisin, Haitong at 4.22% APR.
Haitong is a Portuguese entity, with a Portuguese FGD but with a branch in Spain.
It offers for investments between €10,000 and €100,000 a 2-year deposit with no possibility of early cancellation, its big drawback.
It has another deposit with a better term: 1 year, and that offers a 4.1% APR, which would be the next most profitable.
It also offers a shorter term, but they would already be surpassed by another entity, Facto (4.06% APR), which by the way also has foreign FGD, in this case, Italy.

In this section, Renault Bank (3.63% APR) and BFS (3.75% APR) are excluded, in addition to those already mentioned. His FGD is from France and Portugal respectively.
The maximum profitability is offered by Pibank, at 3.34% APR. It is a bank of Ecuadorian origin, but in Spain it has its own file and is registered with the FGD.
Your deposit is a fixed term of 12 months, not very long, and it comes with the possibility of early cancellations, which previous deposits do not.

We wrote this article because we did not receive an email from a ""regular reader"" who was "" struck by the fact"" that we never talk about Banca Sistema.
The answer to his ""curiosity"" is precisely that we do not choose branchless deposits in Spain as our favorites. We think that the difference between what Banca Sistema offers compared to, for example, Haitong, is not enough to accept its drawbacks.
During this last year, there have always been similar offers from entities with a branch in Spain versus those without, and that is why we have focused on the former.
Which to choose? Before deciding on one, we must choose the term, and we continue to believe that terms are not very long for the following reasons:
A factor that could make us think otherwise is that in the month of August the Euribor has fallen slightly after 22 consecutive months of increases.
But we do not believe that it will affect deposits and that they will begin to decline. Keep in mind that most banks are still not giving anything, the same as when the Euribor was negative.
Therefore, terms of 1 year or less are still the most appropriate for us.
A good decision is to diversify. Peck a little of everything and you will always be right, at least in part. All of the deposits mentioned in this article are good candidates.
…What do you choose? Leave us a comment.


On the Raisin platform there are more than 20 bank deposits that offer a profitability of at least 4% APR, reaching up to 4.4% APR. Are they worth it?
With the interest rate at 4.5% in the Euro Zone, the Euribor at more than 4% and above all, the ECB's deposit facility, what the central bank pays to the banks that park their money there, is in 4%; We would all think that it would be relatively easy to find deposits or accounts at 4% APR.
But reality is not like that. Yes, there are offers at 4% APR, but they are from foreign entities, some with a branch in Spain and of course, they are small and/or newly created and all online.
Banca Sistema increases the profitability of its term deposits contractable through Raisin, up to 1.41% APR.
Also, if you are a new Raisin customer, you can get €150 bonus: €100 welcome and €50 for the friend plan."
261,New deposits now available at 4.06% APR for the Facto Account on its public website,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ya-disponible-los-nuevos-depositos-al-406-tae-de-cuenta-facto-en-su-web-publica/,29/08/2023,"Facto has already made available to all clients the new interest rates, of up to 4.06% APR, which came into force on August 27 and could only be consulted by the bank's clients.
The entity has also updated its calculator, in addition to the rest of its website, adapting it to the new profitability of its products.
It has been an expected increase, even deposits with a term of 6 to 12 months have exceeded the expectations of many people, including us.
The 6-month deposit, the term that we feel most comfortable with because it is a non-cancellable deposit and due to the upward evolution of the rates that you can see in the table below, is currently the most profitable on the market.
The next on the list of the most profitable 6-month deposits is Haitong, which gives 0.25 percentage points less (3.81% APR), and the third on the list goes to 3% APR.
As a criticism, the bank should start paying the Savings Account again. He has been unpaid since June 28, 2021.
In fact, all clients who registered with the bank since February 24, 2020 have not received any remuneration in their savings account.
>> Consult the pdf with the new Facto offer.
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."
262,Facto increases the profitability of its deposits to 4% APR from just 6 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/factu-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-hasta-el-4-tae-desde-solo-6-meses/,28/08/2023,"Facto increases its deposits up to 4% APR, and also offers it from very short terms: only 6 months; but if you want for longer, you can too.
The bank offers this interest rate from 180 days to 449 days.
It has also increased the terms from 3 months to 6 months, 0.25 percentage points more, as well as those from 450 days to 719 days.
The longest terms have remained as they were, at 3% APR; but it is indifferent, because we do not recommend these products for 2 reasons: the entity does not allow early cancellations, and we believe that rates will continue to rise.
It was an expected increase, the last change made by the bank was in the month of May, and it has not disappointed. At 6 months it is the most profitable deposit on the market and we believe it is the most appropriate for these times.
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
263,Abanca offers the deposit Now at 3.1% APR and a 12-month term to VIP clients,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/abanca-ofrece-el-deposito-ya-al-31-tae-y-a-12-meses-de-plazo-a-clientes-vip/,24/08/2023,"Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term.
A 3.1% APR is an interest rate within the range of those we consider already interesting and the 12-month term is not excessively long.
The problem we have with this product is that it discriminates between some customers and others. It's the bank's way of pissing off the staff, because in this digital age, eventually we all find out about the existence of these offers.
The characteristics of this product are:
This deposit can be contracted by selected clients from outside Galicia and for money from other entities.
If the money is already in Abanca, the interest rate will be 1.78% APR (1.75% TIN).
This offer will be valid until September 30, 2023.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca continues to offer its online account with a €300 bonus and 2% APR profitability in exchange for payroll until December 31, 2023."
264,"Who is in Pichincha, if Pibank gives much more? 1% vs 1.51% and 2% vs 3.34%",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/quien-esta-en-pichincha-si-pibank-da-mucho-mas-1-vs-151-y-2-vs-334/,23/08/2023,"Pibank is only the online office of Banco Pichincha. For all intents and purposes it is the same bank, with the peculiarity that you must operate online.
The only disadvantage of Pibank is not having the offices of Banco Pichincha. But taking into account that Pichincha only has 12 offices and is present in only 6 Spanish cities: Alicante, Barcelona, ​​Madrid, Murcia, Valencia and Zaragoza; It is not a great advantage to be from Pichincha.
However, for savers, there is a big difference between the online office and physical offices. The profitability of the paid account is 50% more in Pibank and almost the deposit.
Pibank offers a 1.51% APR for the savings account, compared to Banco Pichincha's 1% APR. This is the only difference. The rest all the same:
The same thing happens to the Remunerated account. The only difference is the profitability: 3.34% APR of Pibank compared to 2% APR of Banco Pichincha.
Who is still at Banco Pichincha? Leave us your comment on the reason for that decision.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"

It is a 12-month deposit with a base profitability of 2.25% APR and if you also domiciliate a payroll, you will get one more percentage point, up to 3.25% APR.
The entity actually accepts payroll, pension or unemployment benefit or makes recurring income of min. €600/month for min. 10 months.
We say that it is not so exclusive, because the same bank offers a 6-month deposit with a profitability of only 0.25 percentage points less.
And above all, if you compare it with other entities such as Facto, Haitong, BFS or Pibank, they offer around 3.5% APR and without asking you for anything.
The characteristics of this deposit are:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
267,Banco Big offers deposits of 3% APR for 6 and 12 months and 2.25% APR for 3 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-big-ofrece-depositos-del-3-tae-a-6-y-12-meses-y-225-tae-a-3-meses/,18/08/2023,"Banco BIG withdrew its 2 welcome deposits at 4% and 3.5% APR for 6 and 3 months in May, which were very well received.
In fact, it overwhelmed their hiring system, and even more than one client was unable to complete the hiring process.
By stopping offering these products, the bank stopped being interesting for savers, because the other 3 deposits that remained were basically unappetizing.
They offered quite little: from 1% APR for 3 months, to 1.75% APR for 6 months and at most, 2.25% APR for 1 year.
But recently the bank has made a large increase in the profitability of these products:
They are not the most profitable deposits on the market, but they are quite decent, and infinitely better than what they were offering a few months ago.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
Big offers the “Big Account”, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
269,ING increases the profitability of its Orange deposits to 1.75% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ing-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-deposito-naranja-hasta-el-175-tae/,16/08/2023,"ING increases the profitability of its 2 Orange deposits by a quarter of a percentage point, up to 1.75% APR, so it is still very little.
It also begins to offer information about these deposits on its public website. Until now we could only access the details of this product in the private area of ​​the electronic banking of the Dutch entity.
From now on the profitability of your 2 deposits are:
It is less than half of what the most profitable deposits on the market give, which reach up to 4% APR. It is even less profitable than Openbank which offers up to 2% APR (see here).
Although it allows early cancellations, why invest in these deposits, if there are accounts on the market that pay 2% APR and with the money completely available?
Either way, how things have changed in just a few months. At the beginning of the year, ING charged commissions for the Orange Account because its clients left ""too much"" money in the account...
The rest of the features are:
From today the account is remunerated at 1.25% APR, but only for clients with a payroll account, otherwise it will be paid at 0.85% APR


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

270,Does Renault Bank discriminate against Spanish clients compared to German ones?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-discrimina-clientes-espanoles-frente-a-los-alemanes/,14/08/2023,"At first glance, if you go to RenaultBank.de (the German website of Renault Bank), it seems that the bank discriminates against Spanish clients compared to German ones, which would not surprise us at all.
On this website, you can read that the entity offers its savings account at 3.55% APR (compared to 2.63% APR in Spain) and deposits with a term of 1 to 5 years of up to 3.75% APR (Spain only 2 years and 3.65% APR).
As you can see, there is a big difference in liquid money, almost 1 percentage point. But if you look more closely, you will realize that these are different offers; and we could not describe it as ""discriminating.""
Actually, the savings account at 3.55% APR; The product with the greatest difference with that of Spain (2.63% APR), is a welcome savings account. An account attracts clients.
That profitability of 3.55% APR only lasts 3 months and then it begins to remunerate, even less than in Spain, at 2.55% APR.
As little as we like being mistreated here, as bank customers, we believe that it is almost better to give us something more forever, than much more for a short time, and then less.
In Germany it has more variety. You can contract deposits from 1 year to 5 years. It is the only thing we can accuse the bank of. Because after 2 years, it offers exactly the same as in Spain:
These deposits, as in Spain, are not cancelable.
We could only criticize the bank for not launching the 1-year fixed term here, a much more appropriate term, being a non-cancellable deposit, and the interest rate, at 3.4% APR, is still quite good.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
271,Deposits continue with extra types of EBN for clients and non-clients until August 31,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-sigue-ofreciendo-los-depositos-con-tipos-extras-para-clientes-hasta-31-de-agosto/,10/08/2023,"EBN Bank will continue until August 31 with the extra interest rates on its deposits of 4 to 12 months for the bank's clients.

They are quite good rates for not very long terms, although far from the 4% APR that Haitong offers (see here):
Initially, these extra rates were only for clients, but the bank subsequently decided to offer the same profitability for new clients, but only with terms of 9 and 12 months.
The rest of the features are:

EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"

This is a minor increase, only 0.2 percentage points, but it already places it very close to the 4% APR for such short terms.
Deposits at 12 and 24 months have also increased slightly. But in this case only 0.1 percentage points, up to 4.1% and 4.22% APR respectively.
Its products are increasingly interesting, it is now a Portuguese entity with a branch in Spain. Although you will need to hire your deposits at Raisin, the end result is similar to a deposit at ING.
The bank will withhold income tax from you and will communicate your data to the Tax Agency and your money is covered by the Portuguese FGD and of course, you do NOT have to file form 720.
Raisin is a simple intermediary, he has no other involvement.
Its deposits are:

The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank. But the 6 and 9 month terms are not long enough to require a cancellation.

The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."
274,"46,345 million euros in ING deposits and accounts, and growing… Incredible",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/46-345-millones-de-euros-en-ing-y-creciendo-increible/,07/08/2023,"We cannot believe when reading ING's income statement for the first 6 months. Savers have 46,345 million euros in the bank, which represents an increase of 9% compared to the previous year.
Of which, 33,567 were in accounts or paid deposits, the rest: payroll account, non-account account...
We do not understand how there are still so many people and so much money in an entity that has mistreated its clients in recent years, even charging them for having the money in the bank. Also, for the record, we can say the same about Santander, BBVA,…
They do not know how much money they are losing and the opportunity cost of putting the money in ING versus, for example, putting it in Renault Bank (see here)
However, we can give a certain explanation for the increase in balance in deposits and accounts, since on the same dates in 2022, the bank could charge you a commission for storing your money in the entity and this year, the bank at the close of June offered up to 2.5% APR.
Still, there is some trickery in these numbers. The bank, just at the close of the data for the first and second quarter, launched two deposits to attract money with returns of 2% APR and 2.5% APR.
ING returned to remunerate its Orange account on November 1, 2022 at 0.3% APR and has progressively risen to the current 0.85% APR or 1.25% APR if you have a payroll account.
It also relaunched its Orange deposits in December 2022 at 12 and 18 month terms and at 0.6% APR and 0.8% APR, and they have been increasing it to the current 1.3% APR and 1.5 % APR respectively.
This offer is far from the most profitable accounts and deposits on the market, which are around 2.5% APR (Renaut Bank at 2.63% APR) and 4% APR (Haitong at 4.12% APR) respectively.

ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
275,Neteller Casinos: Why is it important for online casinos to offer fast payouts?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/casinos-de-neteller-por-que-es-importante-que-los-casinos-en-linea-ofrezcan-pagos-rapidos/,07/08/2023,"One of the main advantages that in-person casinos have is that payments made within the premises are executed immediately. That is, players can acquire the casino's currency or chips quickly and, if they win, they can request the exchange of their chips or credits into real money instantly.
This possibility that each user has to manage their funds immediately is, without a doubt, an attraction that many miss in online casino platforms. For some it may even seem somewhat unfair that deposits at these online casinos are practically instantaneous, but withdrawal requests involve a much longer waiting time.
The truth is that there is little to do in these cases, as they are online platforms, they must meet minimum security requirements and carry out verifications to confirm each transaction. And be careful, this is perfectly logical, since the company does not have the user face to face and must ensure that everything is in order.
Although, on the other hand, if these withdrawals take a long time, players may end up dissatisfied with the casino's service, which is why it is strictly necessary for each online operator to execute payments quickly, but without bypassing any security measures. In short, they must achieve a perfect balance.
If you want to delve a little deeper into this topic and learn which types of operators tend to be faster with their payments, then continue reading carefully.
Neteller is basically an online wallet that will allow you to withdraw, deposit or execute transfers online. Its use today is massive and has millions of users around the world.
In this sense, an online casino with Neteller is simply an ordinary gaming platform that has the particularity of working with this option to execute online payments.
Neteller casinos to play faster and withdraw with greater confidence have expanded and are among the most used at the moment.
But this is not new, since the 2000s this method has been in force and has been used by a large number of people to make payments to their online casino accounts, even surpassing classic options such as credit cards. and debit.
Now, the speed that Neteller offers to execute deposits and withdrawals on these casino platforms is extremely fast, therefore, casinos with Neteller have been associated over time with operators that have a fast speed in processing their withdrawals. and payments in general.
There are several reasons why an online casino should aim to maintain decent payout speeds. Among the most important are the following:
Fast payouts attract a large number of players
As we already mentioned, one of the things that is most missed about physical casinos is that immediate management of the profits obtained, therefore, when an online casino platform executes its transactions quickly, it is normal for its user base to maintain or grow. , since all players like and benefit from managing their money instantly, without many delays.
On the other hand, the fact that users have quick access to their winnings allows online casinos to retain them for a while longer, since they are probably going to have fun again within their platform.
Fast payments = good reputation
Another key factor for the success of any online casino operator is its reputation, and this is often linked, of course, to the speed and security of the payments made within it.
Keep in mind that an online operator that executes payments quickly and without hindrance may have a better reputation than one that takes a long time to process any type of transaction.
Having become clear why it is important to have fast payments on a casino platform and knowing one of the types of operators that best meet this characteristic (Neteller casinos), it is also pertinent to point out some other considerations that must be kept in mind at the moment. to request a payment or withdrawal in this type of casinos.
First, when a player makes a withdrawal request, no matter how fast the Neteller platform is, for example, they will always have to wait a few hours for the casino until it can verify and confirm the transaction.
On the other hand, if you want to avoid headaches, the best thing you can do is have an alternative payment method to make your withdrawal requests, in case your main option fails or is no longer available within the casino you are at. recorded for any unforeseen reason.

276,"More detail about the Revolut Flexible Account: it is not an account, it is a Monetary Fund",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/mas-detalle-sobre-la-cuenta-flaxible-de-revolut-no-es-cuenta-es-un-fondo-monetario/,03/08/2023,"We made it clear in our previous post that the 3.4% Revolut account is NOT a bank account and not covered by the FGD. It is an investment product, more specifically a Monetary Fund.
Therefore, the money you invest in that ""account"" does not remain in Revolut as liquid money, but in securities referenced to assets that will fluctuate.
The bank itself clearly warns that ""the value of investments can fluctuate and you may receive less than the original investment or lose the full value of the initial investment.""
Furthermore, ""past performance and forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future results.""
Revolut's solvency affects the Revolut Account, which is a traditional bank account.
The money we put in that account, the bank invests in whatever it considers, leaving a small reserve for reimbursements.
In case the bank does it wrong, and goes bankrupt, the money deposited in this account is guaranteed up to €100,000 per person by the FGD, in this case the Lithuanian one.
In the case of the Flexible Account, it is totally different. You put the money in the account, and the bank invests it in a Monetary Fund and you are the owner of said participation.
Revolut is simply an intermediary that takes your money and invests it. In the event of Revolut bankruptcy, you should not worry, you have the fund shares.
In short, the money in the Flexible Account is in a separate accounting of the bank. You have no bank risk.
The risk of this account is what you invest the money in. By putting money in this account you become an investor, in this case of a monetary fund.
A monetary fund obtains its profitability from the positive evolution of interest rates. There are no more risks if you invest in Euros. This is not the case if, for example, you invest in dollars, you would also be exposed to the exchange rate.
Currently, the outlook for the evolution of the interest rate is positive, so everything will be fine for these funds as long as the situation persists.
Revolut offers great liquidity to the Flexible Account, but everything can change.
It indicates that it allows you to withdraw funds at any time, but establishes a daily limit of 5 million euros. Be careful, it is not per client, but in TOTAL.
But what happens if interest rates suddenly start to fall and your profitability drops or even starts to lose. People will want to withdraw their funds... don't you see the problem?
Monetary funds are not liquid money, but are invested in things (public treasury, company debt...) and although they have very long payment terms, you must wait until they mature, and if you want it sooner, someone has to buy it from you and It will be at the price that they want to buy it from you. You won't know it, but it will translate into the amount of money that Revolut returns to you.
If you read the information on their website, everything is confusing, and they continually review SAVINGS, SAVINGS, SAVINGS. But it really is an investment.
The general press does not help either, they only echo the bank's statement and are misleading. They talk about accounts, deposits, savings, and NO. We repeat, it is an investment.
As an investor, although with a more conservative profile, you must be aware of things; From one day to the next everything can change, it will depend on the monetary policy of the ECB, and if you invest in dollars or pounds... well, even more worried about the currency exchange rate.
…and from www.tucapital.es we ask ourselves: What need does a saver have to get into this mess by having short-term deposits that earn the same amount right now?
We remind you that in 2008, 40 of the 49 super-safe monetary funds lost money (see here).


The profitability of the Revolut Flexible Account reached up to 3.97% as of January 15, 2024, which the entity announces on its website.
That almost 4% APR, which you add to the ""account"" that ""pays interest daily"" and ""withdraw funds when you need it"", makes many not resist the temptation.
More than 350 million euros has been captured by Revolut in its Flexible Account among Spanish savers according to a press release issued by the bank itself.
There are 350 million euros invested in a monetary fund that people do not know and think is a traditional account.
If you read a Revolut news item in the press and see that it offers a 3.7% APR. Be careful.
Your normal account, the Revolut, if it is a traditional bank account, with FGD and services. But the Flexible account, the one that gives you 3.7% APR, is not a bank account."
277,How to reduce the risks when betting online and not lose your winnings,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/como-reducir-los-riesgos-al-apostar-en-linea-y-no-perder-tus-ganancias/,02/08/2023,"The world of gambling has grown tremendously in recent years, largely because it offers a convenient and entertaining way to try your luck from the comfort of home, offering many hours of fun to people around the world. However, it is essential to remember that gambling in casinos involves money and that is why you must act responsibly and with caution to avoid possible risks and financial losses.
In this article, we will explore effective strategies to reduce the risks when betting online, so you will have a great gaming experience wherever you are, without jeopardizing your winnings or financial stability.
Gambling, such as casino or sports betting, can be attractive, with the promise of exciting wins and immersive gaming experiences. However, it carries inherent risks that must be recognized. For example, whenever you bet money, you have an equal chance of winning or losing everything, and those risks are even greater in certain games, where the house edge is greater than in others. Engaging in self-awareness and understanding the potential dangers is the first step toward a guide to online gambling and responsible gambling.
As we told you before, responsible gaming is the key to a positive online gaming experience. It involves understanding that gaming is for entertainment and setting limits to prevent it from becoming a destructive habit. Irresponsible gambling can have serious consequences for both your finances and your overall well-being. But don't worry, because the casinos themselves have tools that can help you play responsibly, such as self-exclusion or weekly or monthly limits.
One of the most crucial aspects of responsible gaming is setting a budget and sticking to it. What do we mean by budget? A certain amount of money that you can comfortably afford to lose, without it affecting your economy or your financial situation. And of course, stay within that limit. This will prevent impulsive behavior and help you maintain control over your gambling activities.
Not all online betting platforms are the same. For example, at casinochileonline.net you can find reliable betting houses to bet without any problems. It is crucial to select reputable and licensed casinos or betting sites to ensure a fair and safe gaming experience. Investigating the credibility of a platform before you start betting can save you from potential scams and fraudulent practices, and this can be done through trustworthy reviews from other players.
For example, on social media and trustworthy websites you can find real reviews from people who have tried the casino and can tell you if they are really worth it. Taking into account payment and withdrawal methods is also essential to have a good gaming experience.
Several strategies can help minimize the risks when betting online. Setting time limits and taking regular breaks during gaming sessions can prevent excessive gaming. Engaging in alternative activities, such as hobbies or exercise, can divert your attention from compulsive gambling behavior.
Online casinos have a great advantage and that is that they have several bonuses and promotions in their offer so that new players choose them over the competition. While these can be advantageous, it is crucial to read and understand the terms and conditions surrounding these promotions – nothing is free. Relying solely on bonuses to succeed in gambling can lead to unwise decisions and financial losses.
Every casino game has odds and a house edge. Understanding these concepts can help you make informed decisions when choosing which games to play. Selecting games with better odds can increase your chances of winning in the long run, such as high RTP slots or table games that you already have practice and feel confident playing.
Perhaps the most critical aspect of responsible gaming is knowing when to quit. Avoid the temptation to chase losses by setting stop losses and recognizing when it's time to stop. Remember, gambling should be enjoyable and not a source of stress or financial pressure.
Responsible gaming is the foundation for a safe and enjoyable online gaming experience. By setting a budget, choosing reputable platforms, recognizing signs of addiction, and implementing effective risk reduction strategies, you can get the most out of online gambling without compromising your winnings or financial stability.

Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun.

278,Revolut offers an account at 3.4% APR. Is it an Account? With FGD? …?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuenta-revolut-al-334-tae-es-una-cuenta-con-fgd-todo-lo-que-debes-de-saber/,01/08/2023,"Revolut, or Revolut Bank, is a mobile bank or neobank in the style of Orange Bank that offers banking services (current account and payment card) through an APP.
The striking thing about this entity is that it offers an ""account"" at 3.4% APR, it would be the most profitable on the market, and some wonder if it is really an account and everything that comes with being a checking account.
Be careful, the Revolut Account IS a bank account, with a Spanish IBAN, with FGD and under all the necessary regulations and supervisions, but the account that gives that 3.4% APR, NO.
As the bank explains, the Revolut account “is a payment account and we consider the money you deposit in it a deposit. These types of accounts are often called “checking accounts,” a type of bank account where you can deposit and withdraw money and make payments.
Furthermore, as the entity has a branch in Spain, you will have an account with a Spanish IBAN (personal income tax withholdings and communication to the Treasury of your data. There is no need for form 720) and under the supervision of the Bank of Spain:

Since it is only a branch of a Lithuanian entity, the FGD that protects your money in that account is the Lithuanian FGD (see here), which according to the FGD, must be at least equal, at least the FGD.
If the branch cannot return your money, the FGD will process the return of your money (see video point 6 of the FGD's frequently asked questions, here).
BUT: the Revolut Account does not offer any profitability. It's just free. It gives you a card and some interesting free services.
This is the Flexible Account, which is NOT a bank account. It is like an account linked to investment funds or some variable asset, with the characteristic that it has very high liquidity.
That 3.4% APR is as of July 6, 2023; It is surely the day that gave the highest profitability.
The bank itself warns you that it is ""subject to daily changes."" ""Its growth is not guaranteed and capital is subject to risk.""
So, our conclusion is that you forget about this topic, unless you are investors, and not savers to whom we usually direct our publications.
You can read all the information about the risks that the bank itself has linked in this product (see here).

It does not become the most profitable deposits that are around 4% APR, but it is quite decent considering that it is only 12 months.
At that term, it is only surpassed by a handful of entities such as Haitong (4% APR), BFS (3.5% APR), Facto (3.5% APR) or Pibank (3.34% APR).

This product is exclusively for new customers who open the Avantio account through digital channels.
The characteristics of this fixed term are:
This product has a dark side, the Avantio Account. It is free only if you have €10,000 invested in a bank product; in addition to other conditions that are easy to meet.
The entity accepts the €10,000 deposit so that you do not pay commissions on the account. So the problem would come after the expiration. You will have to cancel the account or you will have to pay €75 in semi-annual commissions (€150 per year).

These were 4 fixed terms whose profitability exceeds those offered to new clients:
It is strange that a bank offers more to existing customers than to new ones. In any case, we believe that discriminating some clients against others always generates controversy.

EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

We were only surprised by the long deadline that the bank has set for a possible review of its products, until September 12, 2023.
It will be the longest term that the bank has set for its products, it has always been about 15 days and this time it will be a month and a half. The most likely thing is because the month of August is the holiday period par excellence in Spain and if we do not have this month, the period would be as always.
The latest increases: in July the Contigo Account up to 2.63% APR and in June, the Tú Deposit up to 3.65% APR.
Of the 2 products, the most interesting is the Contigo Account, because its 2-year deposit does not allow early cancellations, and that is currently a drawback with the prospect of more increases.

We were only surprised by the long deadline that the bank has set for a possible review of its products, until September 12, 2023.
It will be the longest term that the bank has set for its products, it has always been about 15 days and this time it will be a month and a half. The most likely thing is because the month of August is the holiday period par excellence in Spain and if we do not have this month, the period would be as always.
The latest increases: in July the Contigo Account up to 2.63% APR and in June, the Tú Deposit up to 3.65% APR.
Of the 2 products, the most interesting is the Contigo Account, because its 2-year deposit does not allow early cancellations, and that is currently a drawback with the prospect of more increases.

284,Orange Bank will increase its savings account to 2% APR in September,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-subira-en-septiembre-hasta-el-2-tae-su-cuenta-de-ahorro/,25/07/2023,"Orange Bank once again announces an increase in futures for its savings account. This time the announcement is more than 1 month in advance, because it will not apply until September 1, 2023.
The increase will be 0.2 percentage points for Orange customers and Former customers, up to 2% APR; and 0.3% percentage points for Non-Orange customers, up to 1.8% APR.
This 2.0% APR will only be for customers with an Orange line, and those who contracted the account before December 19, 2022. Before that date, the account was only contractable by savers with an Orange line, even if it later ceased to have a contract. with the mobile company.
Thus, the profitability of this account will be as follows:
The rest of the features remain unchanged:
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.
On December 19, Orange Bank allows you to open an account without the need for an Orange mobile line. But these customers will receive 0.8% APR instead of 1% APR. Former customers maintain the 1% APR.
On March 1, the bank raised it to 1.5% (Orange clients) and 1.3% APR (without Orange line).
On June 1, it reached 1.8% and 1.5% APR, and in just over 1 month, up to 2% and 1.8% APR.
A few days ago, Orange, the company on which Orange Bank depends, announced that it wants to sell the banking entity.
It has entered into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas, which already has Banco Cetelem in Spain.
For many, it is even good news, because Orange scares many many people. The bad thing is the uncertainty of BNP's commercial strategy that it will apply to Orange Bank clients.
Nothing should worry the bank's 200,000 clients at the moment. We have had similar cases and we have told them on this website such as that of Ibanesto, Oficina Directa or COINC.

We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
285,Openbank offers a deposit at 2.01% APR or 3.07% APR if you direct deposit your income,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/openbank-ofrece-un-deposito-al-201-tae-o-al-307-tae-si-domicilias-tus-ingresos/,24/07/2023,"Openbank launches a 6-month deposit with a profitability of 2% APR, which rises to 3% APR if you direct deposit your income for at least 4 months during the validity of the product.
Consider the bank as income, payroll, pension, unemployment benefit or monthly income of at least €600 per month.
A deposit right now at 2% APR falls short, 3% APR could attract some savers, but if they demand income, they lose all interest, at least for those who do not yet have income in this entity.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
This deposit will be in effect until September 4, 2023.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.

287,The main technologies that have disrupted the online casino sector,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/las-principales-tecnologias-que-han-alterado-el-sector-de-los-casinos-en-linea/,20/07/2023,"One of the fastest growing subsectors of the entertainment industry in recent years is online gambling, which has seen an incredible surge in popularity. In accordance with the needs of the sector, technology is beginning to advance rapidly.
Game innovation seeks to offer customers of the best online casinos the most comfortable gaming environment. As a result, many of today's technological trends have permanently altered the way we view gambling. Let's examine some recent changes that have occurred at the highest paying online casino. What technological advances have influenced online gambling?
Many players around the world prefer slot machines to other types of gambling. Online slots have appeared as a result of current trends, bringing the simple idea and traditional style of traditional slots to the online environment. In this case, 3D animation helped significantly.
Modern real money casinos incorporate a lot of animation into their games, and there is often a narrative that players follow. 3D slot machine technology has altered the way we view and understand online slots.
In its early stages, virtual reality may have seemed like a pipe dream, but it is now widely used in online gaming. Players can interact with staff and other players in virtual reality to give the impression of being in a traditional offline casino.
While it obviously doesn't have an overall impact, it does contribute to the development of a fun environment appropriate for the game. You will need a specific headset to use this technology, which is a drawback.
Artificial intelligence is a technology that aims to replace humans with computers to carry out common tasks in homes and workplaces. Nowadays, online casinos frequently use artificial intelligence.
Predictive modeling and machine learning, for example, can suggest games to players on gaming websites they frequently visit. Another aspect of artificial intelligence that is quickly taking off in online casinos is the live chat feature.
The following categories describe the various ways in which artificial intelligence is used in the online casino platform:
Casinos can better adapt to the needs, wants, and desires of their customer base through the use of data models and predictive analytics. By implementing these best business practices, casinos can evaluate customer preferences and feedback to modify and improve their services while raising the level of product quality.
Gaming sites track player interests and market trends, and use this information to create new games and improve existing ones. Players are guaranteed to benefit from their online gaming experience and are more likely to return to a specific casino as a result of this.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun. However, beyond the entertainment, there are valuable lessons about managing personal finances. Each decision made in roulette or blackjack, for example, contains strategies applicable not only in the game, but also in our daily finances.
In the wide universe of online gaming, Nomini Casino shines as an oasis of fun and excitement. In an environment where the daily routine can be tedious, having a trustworthy and entertaining space to relax is essential.
With a wide variety of games ranging from the most popular slots to classic table games, this online casino offers a unique gaming experience for every type of player.
Casinos are popular places for those looking for excitement and entertainment, but they are also known for their mathematical advantage in all online casino or sportsbook games."
288,"Self Bank now offers a 3-month deposit and a 3% APR, the most profitable for that term",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/self-bank-ofrece-ahora-un-deposito-a-3-meses-y-al-3-tae-el-mas-rentable-del-mercado/,19/07/2023,"Self Bank offers a deposit with a 3-month term and a 3% APR for new money, becoming the most profitable deposit on the market for that term, along with the Facto Account.
The drawback is that the term is somewhat short for a bonus offer. It only lasts 3 months and then you have to opt for less profitable deposits: 1 year at 2% APR or 2 years at 2.75% APR.
Thus, for example, Facto allows you to contract your deposit over and over again at 3% APR. Of course, Self Bank allows you to cancel early, losing only the interest generated. But in a period of 3 months, it is not so important.
We must also consider the Renault Bank savings account, you put the money there, and it gives you 2.63% APR for an indefinite period, it is only a ""little"" less profitable than Self Bank.
Having said all this, we do not believe that it will attract many new clients, rather we believe in an offer that will be worth it to the bank's existing clients and that has some savings outside the entity.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
This offer will be valid until August 31, 2023.
As the only requirement, the bank asks to have the Self Account current account without commissions:
The current account characteristics are:


Self Bank takes months to make changes to its savings products. We have to go back to the month of October, when I set the profitability of its 4 term deposits that are available to all clients.
This fact contrasts with its activity in the post-summer months and it would not be surprising if it makes changes soon, but it will surely be for the worse.
Self Bank launches another term again, this time for 24 months, but less profitable than the existing ones, at 2.75% APR, which is added to the list of the 3 deposits that the bank had already been offering, which give up to 3 .3% APR.
The lower profitability of the new 2-year deposit is due to the fact that the bank also allows it to be contracted with money that the client already has in the bank, unlike the other 3 that require new money.
Self Bank launches 2 new deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months with returns of up to 3.3% APR and extends the 3-month deposit at 3.05% APR that it had been offering since July.
The 3 deposits do not ask for anything, neither payroll nor linked products, you just have to deposit new money into the bank"
289,BBVA gives you €210 for direct debiting just 1 receipt for 6 months in your Online Account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bbva-te-da-210e-por-domiciliar-solo-1-recibo-durante-6-meses-en-su-cuenta-online/,18/07/2023,"It has been a long time since we talked about BBVA, because this entity, like Santander or CaixaBank, refuses to remunerate our money. But everything will come.
Its only interesting product: the Online Account without commissions and without conditions (it only requires that you be a new customer), now offers up to €210 if you direct debit a single receipt at the bank.
Specifically, the bank offers:
In return he demands:
Receipts from companies valid for the promotion:
This offer, as stated in the terms and conditions, is not compatible with other offers. So you must choose between this offer or the Amigo Plan that we talk about below.
>> See details of the promotion
BBVA offers its friend plan to attract clients to its Online Account without commissions (TIN 0%, APR 0%) in which it gives cash to both the client (godfather) and the new client (godson).
Specifically, BBVA offers:
This offer was activated on February 1, 2022 and has been in effect intermittently. This time, it will be until September 30, 2023.
All BBVA customers can join the plan and start inviting their friends and get a bonus of up to €150.
> See legal bases of the promotion
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, you can hire it, but you will surely be left out of the Amigo Plan and perhaps some more disadvantages.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."

It only offers 0.5 percentage points more than the previous offer, which was 3 months ago, in March (see here).
It is a fairly low offer keeping in mind that there are savings accounts at that rate and deposits of almost 4% APR and without asking for it to be new money.
Of course, a strictly 3-month deposit is the third most profitable deposit, after Facto (3.0% APR), Haitong (2.8% APR) and MyInvestor (2.75% APR)
The characteristics of this product are:
To be able to contract this product you must bring money to ING until July 31, 2023, which represents an increase in any of your accounts (ORANGE Account, PAYROLL Account or NoAccount Account).
According to ING, the new income for your deposit is:
The great advantage of this offer is that it allows you to cancel early, and in addition, you will always charge at least 1.5% APR.
In short, any offer is welcome, and that ING is launching promotions like this, we can even be happy. How things have changed at ING.
We know of clients who have tried to drain money from the bank and ING has counter-offered them with a 12-month deposit and a 2.5% APR.

ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

292,EBN also signs up for the feint: it offers 2.9% APR for 4 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-tambien-se-apunta-a-lo-de-amago-ofrece-29-tae-a-4-meses/,11/07/2023,"If you have a deposit in EBN and decide not to renew, the bank can offer you a 2.9% APR for 4 months, 0.4% APR more than what it offers on a generalized basis.
EBN is a somewhat different entity, it offers higher rates to clients than to non-clients, but this counter offer is something new, and we don't like it, as we already said in the case of ING.
We do not know if it will offer this to all clients who threaten, but we do know of cases where they have done so. We also do not know if there are other offers and at other terms. Everyone should try if they are interested.
In this case it is a slight improvement of its general offer for clients:
The rest of the features are the same as deposits for new customers.
However, it is still behind Facto or Haitong.
The atypical thing happens in this bank. Treat existing customers better than new ones, with a difference of up to half a percentage point:
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are:
The characteristics of your account are as follows:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
293,…And if you decide to take money from ING: it offers you 2.5% APR for 12 months. feint trick,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/y-si-decides-llevarte-dinero-de-ing-te-ofrece-25-tae-truco-amago/,10/07/2023,"Banks, like many people, do not value what they have until they see that they are going to lose it. In this case, ING, when they see that they are going to lose liabilities, try to retain it, offering something similar to their selected VIP clients.
Nobody likes to be treated like second-class people, and ING is doing it, which added to their bad generic offers, people are deciding to take their money elsewhere.
At this point, and not always, the bank makes you an offer to stay. The proposal is varied, but the most generic is a 12-month deposit and 2.5% APR for any amount up to €100,000.
Perhaps, at that point it is already too late. The client who has decided to look for another bank already knows that the competition offers up to 4% APR.
In any case, for a customer who wants to continue with ING and has not obtained the VIP offer, they could try the trick: ""feign to take the money"" and wait for them to offer this product.
You must start a process to transfer your money from ING to another bank.
During the process, the bank shows you this screen before confirming the operation.

The unlucky ones must settle for the following offer:

But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

295,Haitong now offers 4% APR or more from 12 month terms,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/haitong-ofrece-un-4-tae-o-mas-a-partir-de-12-meses-de-plazo/,06/07/2023,"Haitong, Spain branch, breaks the 4% APR barrier and offers it with a term of 12 months or more.
The profitability of shorter terms also increases: 3-month terms at 2.8% APR or 6 months at 3.61% APR.
Haitong Bank is a Portuguese entity with a branch in Spain, whose products can be purchased through the Raisin platform.
Taking out a deposit in this bank would be similar to ING: You will have personal income tax withholdings and the bank will communicate your data to the Portuguese Tax Agency and FGD. The only addition is that you must use Raisin as an intermediary.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.

The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."
296,"Wizink LOWERS the profitability of its deposits, while the Euribor marks maximums….",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-baja-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-mientras-el-euribor-marca-maximos/,05/07/2023,"Wizink has dropped, you read it correctly, it has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.3% APR to 2.75% APR, while yesterday the Euribor reached a high of 4.164%.
And it was not because it is a stratospheric offer, because there are other entities that surpassed it in that same term such as Haitong (4% APR), Facto (3.55% APR), BFS (3.5% APR) or Pibank (3. 34% APR).
Thank goodness, the bank has kept the other 2 deposits unchanged:
The 12-month term was the most interesting, and still is, but as we say, there are better offers in other banks.
The characteristics of the products, subject to changes, are:
This offer will be valid until August 31, 2023.
Recently, the bank raised the profitability of its savings account from 0.5% APR to 1% APR. But this increase only applies to new accounts.
If you already had an account, it will continue at 0.5% APR:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
297,How Bitcoin technology could revolutionize supply chains,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/como-la-tecnologia-bitcoin-podria-revolucionar-las-cadenas-de-suministro/,05/07/2023,"Bitcoin has an underlying technology and built-in infrastructure known as blockchain technology. This blockchain is a distributed public ledger that contains transaction records and is managed by thousands of computing nodes. It is quite difficult to manipulate or interfere with blockchain technology. Any suggested change to blockchain technology requires the support of 51% of computing nodes. Therefore, it is quite complicated to propose changes to the blockchain.
Bitcoin was the first currency to popularize blockchain technology and now other companies are applying this technology. These companies can use blockchain technology to track any transaction, allowing documents, personal information, and this electronic currency to be shared. Blockchain has a distribution across the network. Therefore, it is difficult to corrupt.
The product of each commercial establishment that reaches an end user represents the collective effort of many organizations and stakeholders, known as the supply chain. Organizations within a supply chain have links through physical and information flows. On the one hand, physical flows involve the transformation, movement and storage of goods and materials and on the other hand, information flows involve coordination between partners to control the daily flow of goods up and down the supply chain. supply and involve long-term planning. Next, we show how Bitcoin technology is revolutionizing supply chains.
Lately, most supply chains run their operations through digital processes. On the other hand, some long-existing lower-tier supply chains still operate manually through pen-and-paper documentation.
While the manual documentation process may work for some, the process can be inefficient in handling large, complex transactions. Moving to blockchain technology can help solve the problem of inefficient transactions that are also relatively slow.
Blockchain allows peer-to-peer transactions, transactions are carried out without the interference of intermediaries such as banks. On the other hand, fiat money is centralized and transactions go through several intermediaries. For each of these intermediaries the person is required to pay a transaction fee to proceed to the next intermediary.
However, with this digital money, transactions are faster, less expensive and without intermediaries. Only supply chain participants and managers have the proper authorization to view settlements, creating a more transparent, accurate and secure form of transactions. Maybe you could open an account at immediate-growth.co and use the exchange to trade, sell or buy Bitcoins.
No one can delete blockchain records and transactions as they are permanent. Furthermore, blockchain is a publicly distributed ledger, therefore, it is very transparent and transactions can be accessed by all blockchain users. Consequently, this transparency of blockchain technology leads to an effective supply chain. Likewise, every step in the supply chain has a secure record, meaning people can trace logistical problems back to their source.
For example, if a construction project is carried out, the contractor can obtain construction components or raw materials traced back to their origin. Product tracking helps increase accountability and transparency, it also prevents illegal activities.
Organizations and companies should consider their sectors, relevant regulations, code of ethics, suppliers, and preferred risk level to help determine supply chain transparency. Blockchain technology will help reduce system inefficiencies, for example, when suppliers try in vain to connect the dots on what needs what, when and how, or any other common challenge.
Many companies are integrating blockchain technology into their operations due to the transparency and good organization that this technology provides. Additionally, authorized users can instantly view all Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain, allowing for greater openness and legitimate records. While there are still challenges to widespread blockchain adoption, this innovation is moving positively today. Therefore, blockchain technology can help revolutionize the supply chain.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Perhaps you are wondering what qualities make Bitcoin considered money? Here's a guide to what makes this digital money so valuable.
Maybe you're wondering why the Bitcoin market is about to explode? Here's why the Bitcoin market will likely adopt this trend."

What happens is that Orange, the company on which it depends, no longer wants to continue in the retail banking adventure and is going to sell it after only 3 and a half years.
It has entered into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas for its sale. This entity already has Banco Cetelem in Spain.
For many, it is even good news, because Orange scares many many people. The bad thing is the uncertainty of BNP's commercial strategy that it will apply to Orange Bank clients.
Nothing should worry the bank's 200,000 clients at the moment. We have had similar cases and we have told them on this website such as that of Ibanesto, Oficina Directa or COINC.
At the moment nothing is known about when it will be sold. Only that the entity has started negotiations for the sale to BNP Paribas.
Even if it is sold, the bank will tell us about the process and the changes. We will have time to make decisions.
No, the entity is healthy and there are no risks for clients.
The only thing we should worry about is the future commercial decision of BNP Paribas. Not much, at least for now.
We do not believe that BNP wants to compare Orange Bank to close it or completely change it in a short period of time, because they know that they would lose all customers.
If they decide to change the commercial strategy, it would be progressive, and we can decide what to do with the account.
We do not know if BNP will retain Orange Bank's banking record or eliminate it and absorb its clients.
In the second case, we would have to see what BNP does with clients from Spain, if they put it within Banco Cetelem, which would be the most logical thing.
In all cases, it may or may not affect the FGD:
We have experienced a few restructurings:
We can see that in all cases, clients lose out over time, and possibly, the same could happen with Orange Bank.
There is only one exception, Evo Banco which offers a decent account (no commissions and no conditions) and an acceptable deposit (2.5% APR for 12 months).
What do you think will happen with Orange Bank? Leave us a comment below.


Cetelem continues trying to capture liabilities with its 4 deposits of up to 4% APR for everyone: new or existing clients.
These products have only been on the market for a few weeks. There are 4 deposits with a term of 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, the most profitable being the shortest term, at 4% APR; and the least profitable, the longest term, at 3.1% APR
Cetelem begins to capture deposits, launching 4 fixed terms from 3 to 18 months and up to 4% APR. They are quite interesting products except for one ""but.""
They are deposits that do not require anything, only that you sign up for a Celetem account, which is where the catch lies, which we will detail below."

The Remunerated Account also increases to 1.25% APR. It is an increase of 0.25 percentage points, but it is still insufficient to compete with the most profitable: 1.75% APR and above.
Deposits for new customers remain unchanged.
Specifically, it offers 4 deposits exclusively for bank clients:
The rest of the features are the same as deposits for new customers.
It is close to Facto or Haitong, but does not surpass them. Thus, it remains the third most profitable option for terms of 12 months or less.

*Cancellable in advance by the client.

EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

The account characteristics are:
Valid Unicaja offer will last until December 31, 2023.
Taking into account profitability and maximum remuneration, both banks are more or less on par during the first year. Unicaja gives a little more interest, but asks you for three times as much money.
During the second year, Bankinter gives you more interest for less money.


UnicajaBanco now offers in its ""Unpaid Online Account"", what a name by the way, a 2% APR for 1 year if you domiciliate your payroll, and if not, at 1% APR.
This profitability is offered to you for a maximum of €30,000. Look what a coincidence, the same as Banco Sabadell.
But we must also say that Unicaja, starting in the second year, does remunerate your money, at 0.5% APR, unlike Sabadell, which does not.
It is hard for us to believe that ING is not the bank with the most fans, but this is what a study carried out by EMO Insights shows.
The bank with the most fans is Banco Mediolanum with 54.4% of its clients who declare themselves admirers of the entity.

However, right now there are quite a few products that exceed 3% APR and are close to 4%. In fact, Renault Bank offers the same (2.63% APR) in its savings account, and you have the liquid money.
An advantage of this deposit is that it can be canceled in advance, both totally and partially. Furthermore, if you do so, not only does it not charge you any commissions, but it will continue to pay you interest, yes, at 1% APR, which is not bad at all.

The entity accepts the €10,000 deposit so that you do not pay commissions on the account. So the problem would come after the expiration. You will have to cancel the account or you will have to pay €75 in semi-annual commissions (€150 per year).

Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.

In addition to offering good interest rates, without requirements, without conditions and it is for ALL clients.
Many of us hate that a bank gives you good things when you are not a customer, and when you already are, it treats you like second class. This is the case in MyInvestor and its savings account (2% APR) or Sabadell and its online account (2.5% APR).
For other banks, the money they already have in the entity has less value, and they offer their deposits only for new money. This is, for example, the ING offer and its 3-month deposit at 2.5% APR or Openbank's 12-month deposit and 1.75% APR.
At Renault Bank it is as simple as opening the Contigo Account, transferring the money and collecting interest. You know that if rates rise, it will be applied automatically and the change will always be communicated to you by email.
The last change, yesterday, in which the bank raised its savings account to 2.63% APR, and during the day sent an email to customers of the change (see below).
As he wrote, this seemed like an advertorial; but no, nobody pays us for this, we would like to. But when something is good, you have to recognize it, just as a few weeks ago we criticized it for being left behind.
As we already said yesterday, at this time only accounts such as the Bankinter or Openbank Payroll (5% APR) exceed the profitability of the Contigo Account.
It offers more than Banco Sabadell (2.5% APR), MyInvestor (2.5% APR), Targo Bank (2.5% APR)... It is even close to Facto's 3-month fixed terms (3.03 % APR) or Haitong (2.7% APR).
In addition, you must also take into account its 2-year deposit and 3.65% APR, although it has several drawbacks, it forms a good duo with the Contigo Account.
The deposit is not the most profitable (3.65% APR), although not far away (4% APR). It is not cancelable and the term is too long, 2 years.
But if we take into account the 2 products, Renault Bank offers both short and long term good interest rates (better or close). So, depending on how you think the types will evolve, you can do:
We believe that rates will still continue to rise, so I would bet almost certainly 100% on the account, or at most, put a small part in the deposit.

MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.

If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
308,Qualities that make Bitcoin considered money,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/cualidades-que-hacen-que-bitcoin-sea-considerado-dinero/,20/06/2023,"The value of this digital money has increased tremendously since the cryptocurrency was introduced in 2009, it has also seen significant ups and downs. This electronic money reached its highest value in April 2021, when the value of this virtual currency was $60,000, however, the value of this virtual money decreased greatly in 2022 and has not yet recovered. Despite the drastic price swings, some investors like Bitcoin's volatility. These investors believe that the value of Bitcoin will increase in the long term.
This digital money does not have any assets to back its value, while, on the other hand, shares or securities represent the ownership and value of a company. This digital money has only been around for over a decade, making it difficult to determine its value.
But what qualities make this digital currency considered money? Below is a guide on these qualities that make Bitcoin considered money.
This electronic asset is believed to be the largest and most traded cryptocurrency globally due to its large market capitalization and therefore lacks intrinsic value. Mining or mining this digital money is an expensive task as it requires expensive hardware and consumes a lot of energy. Likewise, the value of this virtual money appears to have a marginal production cost.
No one can destroy this digital currency. This virtual money is based on blockchain technology managed by thousands of computer nodes spread around the world. Furthermore, transacting with this digital money is quite simple. The Federal Reserve's money transfer system is disconnected from fiat currency.
This virtual currency has a limited supply and this scarcity contributes greatly to the value of Bitcoin. This digital money has a strict limit whereby people can only mine 21 million Bitcoins. The public has already mined 19 million Bitcoins, leaving 2 million in reserve. Due to this limited supply, demand increases because everyone wants to have a part of this great innovation. Eventually, the value of this electronic money will increase, hence the reason why this electronic asset is considered money.
Every investor can buy this digital money and can trade it in various places, https://bitcoin-360-ai.co/, or will invest it to make profits. Likewise, this electronic currency has a greater yield potential. This virtual asset also has a built-in infrastructure known as blockchain that helps validate transactions. Blockchain is a distributed public ledger that enables transparent, less costly and fast transactions. This digital money has no barriers to entry and allows for secure cross-border transactions. You can easily send remittances with this digital money. For example, El Salvador and the Central African Republic were the first countries to convert this digital money into legal tender.
This electronic money can be sent anywhere with an internet connection in seconds, with a final payment settlement probability of one hour. Bitcoin users who have memorized their private keys carry their Bitcoin holdings with them.
It is quite difficult to know the total number of people who have invested in this electronic money, however, the number of people registering on exchanges to buy, trade or sell Bitcoins has increased tremendously, therefore, it is correct to say that the adoption of this virtual money has increased. Furthermore, it is quite easy to buy, spend and store this virtual asset.
Since this virtual asset operates on a blockchain ledger, no one can counterfeit a Bitcoin. The blockchain keeps track of transactions and ensures that the system continues to function within the rules based on the original rules established by Satoshi Nakamoto.
The value of this electronic currency is notoriously volatile, therefore it is quite difficult to predict whether it will continue to rise or fall. Consequently, it would be best to allocate a small percentage of your Bitcoin holdings to your portfolio.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.

Maybe you're wondering why the Bitcoin market is about to explode? Here's why the Bitcoin market will likely adopt this trend."
309,Why the Bitcoin market is about to explode,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/por-que-el-mercado-de-bitcoin-esta-a-punto-de-estallar/,20/06/2023,"This digital currency has been on the rise since its creation in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. This electronic currency has been around for thirteen years and the Bitcoin network has seen rapid growth from a digital currency to a trillion-dollar industry. This virtual currency has an underlying technology known as blockchain, a publicly distributed ledger that records and validates transactions. Thanks to this blockchain technology, transactions are fast and less expensive.
The use of this digital money varies from country to country. For example, El Salvador and the Central African Republic have legalized this virtual currency as legal tender. Panama is still in the process of converting this digital money into legal tender. Likewise, there is an immense increase in the use and price of this virtual asset for several reasons. Here's why the Bitcoin market is about to explode.
Nowadays people consider this virtual currency to be a haven against market volatility and inflation. Fiat money is subject to inflation as compared to this electronic currency it does not have a limited supply which has a strict maximum limit. The public will only be able to mine 21 million Bitcoins and there are currently 2 million Bitcoins in circulation as the public has already mined 19 million Bitcoins. This limited supply of this electronic money makes it a hedge against inflation because its value increases due to increased demand.
This virtual money does not lose its value over time compared to fiat money which loses its value over time. Therefore, public and private institutional investors are converting their cash treasuries into this digital money. These well-established companies and large corporations have great confidence in Bitcoin, which contributes to its price rise.
People around the world use this digital money to make transfers, especially when sending remittances. We all know that sending money when working abroad can be tiring and overwhelming, especially when transacting with fiat money. Many middlemen are involved when transacting with conventional money, making the transactions more expensive and time-consuming.
Nowadays, people are opting for this electronic money as there are few barriers to entry and transactions are very easy. You just need to get the recipient's Bitcoin wallet address and you will be able to send them this digital money instantly via the Granimator.co app from the comfort of your home. There are no cross-border barriers preventing people from transacting with Bitcoin.
Furthermore, this digital currency makes it easier for people to do business beyond their borders. If you want to get a product or service in another country or continent, you can do so as this digital money promotes instant deals. This is why this electronic asset helps to expand your borders and carry out transactions easily. This ease of transacting across borders also contributes to the rapid rise in Bitcoin prices.
When this digital money first appeared, many governments did not agree with the currency because it lacked the required regulation. This decentralized digital money means that no financial institution or government can regulate or manipulate the currency. Governments have a lot of power over fiat currencies unlike Bitcoin. Therefore, governments will also have to earn this virtual currency like everyone else.
On the other hand, the popularity of this digital money has increased enormously, which the government cannot ignore. For example, the Japanese government had no choice but to recognize this digital money. Furthermore, the government of El Salvador even made Bitcoin legal tender in the country.
This digital money has been gaining more acceptance worldwide, which is a result of the factors mentioned above. This virtual money offers its users many advantages, therefore the world is slowly moving towards this digital money.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.

310,"Haitong, Spain branch, slightly increases the 12-month deposit",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/haitong-sucursal-espana-sube-ligeramente-el-deposito-a-12-meses/,19/06/2023,"Haitong, Spain branch, slightly increases the profitability of its 12-month deposit, up to 3.8% APR and its most profitable deposit is close to 4% APR (3.98% APR).
It also offers terms from 3 months, with very good profitability: 3-month terms at 2.7% APR or 6 months at 3.35% APR.
We already said last time that since Banco BIG (see here) withdrew its 6-month deposit at 4% APR, Haitong became the most profitable of the banks with a branch in Spain.
Haitong Bank is a Portuguese entity with a branch in Spain, whose products can be purchased through the Raisin platform.
Taking out a deposit in this bank would be similar to ING: You will have personal income tax withholdings and the bank will communicate your data to the Portuguese Tax Agency and FGD. The only addition is that you must use Raisin as an intermediary.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.
For our taste, the most interesting deposits are those with a term of 3 to 12 months, with returns of 3.35% to 3.80% APR, very similar to Facto's offer (3% APR at 3 months, 3.5 % APR at 6, 9 and 12 months or BFS at 12 months at 3.5% APR).
It beats MyInvestor's offer at 3% APR for 6 and 12 months, although in this case it is cancelable.
It is also better than what Wizink offers for 12 months, at 3.3% APR, which in this case is also cancelable.
The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."
311,Openbank raises the Welcome Savings account to 1.75% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/openbank-sube-la-cuenta-ahorro-bienvenida-hasta-el-175-tae/,16/06/2023,"Openbank has raised its Welcome Savings account from 1.25% APR to 1.75% APR during the first year and for a maximum of €100,000.
The account does not require anything, no payroll, no receipts, no income. Just if you are a new customer. However, it is a fairly weak offer compared to what is on the market: more than 2% APR and without asking you to be a new customer.
Additionally, if you have a payroll, you can sign up for the Welcome Payroll Savings account. The interest rate on this account is much more interesting: 5.12% APR. But it limits the maximum remuneration to only €5,000.
In this way, you could have: €5,000 at 5.12% APR and another €100,000 at 1.75% APR.
The characteristics of both accounts are:
In the event that you direct debit your payroll, you additionally receive a 0.5% bonus on the bills you direct debit for electricity, gas, telephone, mobile phone and Internet.
These welcome offers are not even the shadow of what it offers to its existing clients who want to take their money to other banks.
Quite a few users of our website and clients of the bank have already told us that when trying to take the money from Openbank to another entity, the bank has called them to counter offer them and that it remains in the entity with deposits of:
The rest of the conditions are:
You can see its detailed conditions by clicking here.
NOTE: This offer is personalized, it does not appear anywhere on your website. You have to call (and they don't always offer it) or they will call you if you transfer your money from Openbank to another entity.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
312,ING relaunches its 3-month deposit but at 2.5% APR for new money,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ing-saca-un-deposito-al-25-tae-para-dinero-nuevo/,15/06/2023,"ING launches a deposit for new money with a profitability of 2.5% APR and a term of 3 months.
It only offers 0.5 percentage points more than the previous offer, which was 3 months ago, in March (see here).
It is a fairly low offer keeping in mind that there are savings accounts at that rate and deposits of almost 4% APR and without asking for it to be new money.
Of course, a strictly 3-month deposit is the third most profitable deposit, after Facto (3.0% APR) and Haitong (2.7% APR).
The characteristics of this product are:
To be able to contract this product you must bring money to ING between June 14 and July 3 that represents an increase in any of your accounts (ORANGE Account, PAYROLL Account or NoAccount Account).
According to ING, the new income for your deposit is:
The great advantage of this offer is that it allows you to cancel early, and in addition, you will always charge at least 1.5% APR.
In short, any offer is welcome, and that ING is launching promotions like this, we can even be happy. How things have changed at ING.
Orange Deposits:
With the following features:
And Orange Account:


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
313,Deutsche Bank tries to capture large payrolls with €360 in cash and 2% APR in the account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/deutsche-bank-trata-captar-grandes-nomina-con-360e-y-2-tae/,14/06/2023,"Deutsche Bank launches an offer to capture payroll, of at least €2,000 per month, with a bonus of €360 and a return of 2% APR on the account for 1 year.
As we can see, it tries to capture large payrolls (€2,000 net per month), and it is also for large capitals, because it requires keeping at least €50,000 in the account to give you that 2% APR.
The bonus payment will be made monthly, €30 net euros per month for 1 year, which adds up to a total of €360.
As a requirement for the €360 bonus:
To obtain the 2% APR on the account you must also:

315,"N26 savings account at 2.26% APR, good alternative but, for now, NOT available to everyone",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuenta-ahorro-de-n26-al-226-tae-una-buena-alternativa-aunque-no-para-todos/,12/06/2023,"N26 launched a savings account at 2.26% APR in mid-May, being one of the most profitable on the market and it does so without asking for anything: without a new client, without payroll or income, and it offers it for an indefinite period of time.
As a drawback, even though there are no client restrictions, the account does not appear to everyone in the APP. The bank has established a progressive scheme for contracting this account, which has caused outrage among clients who still do not have this product available.
The account features are excellent:
In addition, the associated checking account has most of the services and free of charge:
Furthermore, your account has a Spanish IBAN, even though the bank is German. That is, it will apply personal income tax withholdings and everything the same as if it were a Spanish bank, but the FGD is German. It's ING style.
Its website informs that the N26 Savings account is for ""eligible"" customers and that they can contract it via their APP.
The bank defines eligible customers as those who have an N26 personal bank account with a Spanish IBAN, have a registered local tax identification number and are a resident of Spain. Therefore, it excludes customers who still have their German IBAN.
If you have joined N26 before May 15, 2023, the product may not appear in your App, so you must wait and keep the APP updated. The implementation is gradual.
We understand that those who have joined after that date should have the product appear automatically. If you are one of those who cannot sign up for the account yet, you must be patient. It's what's left.


A couple of days ago we tried to find a good alternative to Orange Bank, and it was an almost impossible task (see here). No offer equals that of Orange Bank, much less improves it.
N26 could be a great alternative that we didn't look at a couple of days ago.
ING is the online bank that has captured the most deposits during the first half of 2023 (3,348 million), according to data from the Bank of Spain.
In fact, it is the online bank with the most money on deposit from savers and with a very large margin. Do you understand now why ING does not increase its deposits more?
Where are those bankers who in times of negative rates came out vehemently saying that if the ECB charges them for putting money in the central bank, they should pass those costs on to clients.
Well, now the ECB pays banks to deposit their money there at 4%. Which banks offer that right now! What are the bankers saying now?"

It offers the same as Targo Bank, Banco Sabadell or Evo Banco and slightly higher than Renault Bank (2.27% APR), and much more (more than half a percentage point or more) than MyInvestor, Orange Bank or Pibank.
Its evolution has been spectacular, from 0.5% APR, in January 1.25% APR, in March 2% APR and now 2.5% APR.
However, there are short-term deposits (3 months) with rates of up to 3% APR and having some peculiar aspects of this entity, it should be considered:
It is just a Savings Account, similar to the ING Orange Account. You will not have any additional services.
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The account characteristics are:
The money is guaranteed by Norway's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.
At the beginning of February, in your Client Area, the entity will provide you with the annual declaration of your account for what you take into account in the income tax return.


Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.7% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
The Norwegian Bank, Bank Norwegian, increases the profitability of its account by one tenth of a point more, to 3.7% APR, 0.2 percentage points more.
It is one of the most profitable on the market for liquid money.
Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.5% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
It surpasses Renault Bank (2.89% APR) by more than half a point or EBN Banco (3% APR for €10,000) and even surpasses the accounts offered by some collaborating banks on the Raisin platform, such as CKV (3.3% APR ), Klarna (3.29% APR) or Distingo (3.20% APR)."

Some entities that stood out in recent years when no one offered anything like Orange Bank or EBN Banco are being left behind, even entities that stood out at the beginning of this deposit war are losing steam, as is the case of Pibank and at times Renault Bank .
Banco Big has been like a shooting star, offering an incredible deposit at 4% APR, but between operational problems and the large number of requests it has left many people in the lurch (see here). Now their deposits are mediocre.
Banco Sabadell continues to provide a good return on its online account, at 2.5% APR for 12 months for new customers, see here, but it is missing something more.
Something similar happens to Evo Banco and its Smart account at 2.5% APR for new customers (see here).
Note: We do not include some entities with welcome deposits or linked accounts and deposits in the comparison.
*: The BFS term is 25 months and we have compared it with 24 months.
*: TargoBank has a 4% early cancellation penalty fee, but it is limited to the interest generated.
Observations:
If you think rates will continue to rise, choose a short-term deposit. Facto and Haitong are good options or even accounts.
If you think that rates will not rise much more, I would choose terms between 1 to 3 years (as long as you are not going to need the money in that time). This way you guarantee good profitability for a long time. If you went with this option, you would choose cancelable deposits like Wizink, Pibak or BFS. Or if you don't care if the money is blocked, then Haitong, BFS, Facto or Renault Bank.
…What is your option? Leave us a comment below.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

It was time for an increase as we have been demanding and the new offer will last 2 weeks, until June 21, 2023.
The previous change was made in the month of April, just over 1 month without changes, but finally, today we received the good news.
This 3.65% APR is among the most profitable, but is surpassed by BFS and Haitong. We also find 12-month deposits from Wizink or Facto or MyInvestor more interesting. Less profitable, but shorter and more appropriate and even conceivable terms.
Your savings account at 2.27% APR, as an account, is still at the top of the ranking, but there are very short-term deposits at 3% APR or almost, and some accounts at 2.5% APR, well, they are no longer It's so attractive.

It was a necessary increase due to everything that happened in the last month or so:
Offer valid until June 21, 2023.
Offer valid until June 21, 2023.
The big drawback of your deposit is that it does not allow early cancellations within 2 years.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

The money deposited in this entity is covered by the Portuguese FGD, and since it has a branch in Spain, the entity applies personal income tax withholdings and the interest generated appears in the income draft, since the bank communicates your data to the Tax Agency.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level.
Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting.

Clients will continue with the 1.1% APR that the bank has been offering since April 3 and always conditional on meeting any linkage requirement. Otherwise, the profitability drops to 0.7% APR.
Be careful, this profitability is for amounts deposited in Evo Banco that exceed €4,000. The first €4,000 will remain in the checking account without remuneration.
New customers who register until July 31, 2023, will have the account at 2% APR until July 31, 2024, when it will be readjusted to the current rate for all customers.
This is an extra bonus for at least 1 year, although the investment is very limited, less than €30,000.
Remuneration is given without requiring ties, and with liquid money.
Evo Banco remunerates the Smart Account of the bank's clients with a 1.1% APR as long as you meet 1 of the following 2 requirements:
Otherwise, the account is remunerated at 0.7% APR.
We remind you that the Smart Account is 2 accounts:
The rest of the features are:
It is the bank's strong point, allowing free debit withdrawals from more than 16,000 ATMs with no minimum amount and no withdrawal limit:
You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €120.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."

Specifically, its most profitable deposit, the 2-year one, which we believe is too long, offers a profitability of 3.98% APR, the highest of the banks with a branch in Spain after the withdrawal of Banco BIG's offer ( see here).
Haitong Bank is a Portuguese entity with a branch in Spain, whose products can be purchased through the Raisin platform.
Taking out a deposit in this bank would be similar to ING: You will have personal income tax withholdings and the bank will communicate your data to the Portuguese Tax Agency and FGD. The only addition is that you must use Raisin as an intermediary.
Its deposits are:
The rest of the features are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.
For our taste, the most interesting deposits are those with a term of 3 to 12 months, with returns of 3.35% to 3.75% APR, very similar to Facto's offer (3% APR at 3 months, 3.5 % APR at 6, 9 and 12 months).
It will surpass MyInvestor's offer at 3% APR for 6 and 12 months, although in this case it is cancelable.
It is also better than what Wizink offers for 12 months, at 3.3% APR, which in this case is also cancelable.
The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.

That 2.53% APR is for any amount of money, as long as you leave €100 in the payment account and without an upper limit.
In addition, it offers, as we indicated, additional services: payment accounts, cards, bizum, cash withdrawals at ATMs...
From now on, without a doubt, it will be one of the preferred accounts for savers, as long as it does not change its characteristics or add requirements:
NOTE: You must always have at least €100 in your payment account. Otherwise, the bank will automatically transfer money from the savings account up to €500 in the payment account. That is, €100 is not remunerated.
As a downside, the bank asks that you meet one of the following 3 requirements to NOT pay commissions:
If you use the account for savings, you will not have to pay commissions, just depositing €10,000 is enough. Of course, don't get lost, because otherwise, you will have to pay €8 per month in account maintenance fees.
The bank gives you a few months of grace, the account being exempt from commissions: the month of contracting and the following 3, even if you do not meet any of the conditions.

TargoBank has also increased, but slightly, the profitability of its 12 and 18 month term deposits and leaves its most profitable 24 month term deposit at 3% APR, unchanged.
The increase is 0.15 percentage points for the 12-month deposit, up to 2.75% APR, and 0.05 percentage points for the 18-month deposit, up to 2.85% APR.
They are deposits that allow early cancellation and are aimed at new clients or money from other entities.
Despite this increase, it is still far behind Wizink, which offers similar and cancelable terms, but with a higher profitability, up to 3.3% APR.
In any case, it is a great offer, one more alternative for savers, especially those who don't like Wizink or other offers.
The other characteristics of these deposits are:
In order to contract these deposits you need to open an account at TargoBank.

Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
TargoBank continues to offer its Amigo Plan, in which the client (sponsor) and the new client (sponsor) can each get €30 for signing up for the Next Account, a PRIME Subscription Account and/or a fixed-term deposit.
The Targo Bank Next Account has a very interesting interest rate, 2.53% APR, an interest rate set in the month of June.
With what has happened in recent weeks/months we can now say that the deposit war has returned, but only for small entities. The big ones like Santander, BBVA or Caixa Bank remain on the sidelines.
The most profitable deposit has already reached 4% APR. A 2% APR is already easy to get and there are more and more offers at 3% APR."

BFS is a good reflection of what has happened. With this latest rate increase, some of its products have multiplied by 7 what the bank offered in June 2022.
Now the most profitable deposit in BFS reaches up to 3.75% APR, which by removing the deposit at 4% APR from Banco Big, BFS becomes the entity with the most profitable deposits on the market (we always talk about entities with a branch in Spain), along with Haitong.
BFS therefore surpasses Wizink (3.3% APR at 12 months cancelable), Facto (3.5% APR from 6 months non-cancelable) or Renault Bank (3.34% APR at 2 years non-cancelable).
However, the most interesting deposit for us is the 12-month term: at 3% cancelable APR or at 3.5% non-cancelable APR. If we had to choose, maybe we would choose the 6-month Facto and the 12-month Wizink.
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until June 4, 2023, and are exclusively for new contributions.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
324,"ING also increases the profitability of its deposits, up to 1.5% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ing-tambien-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-hasta/,01/06/2023,"ING, in addition to the expected increase in profitability in its Orange Account, has also increased the interest rate on its 2 fixed-term deposits.
It was a more than predictable increase, by putting the Orange Account at 1.25% APR, matching the profitability of the deposits that it had been marketing.
The increase is 0.25 percentage points in both terms:
However, it is still not competitive, when there are accounts without requirements at 2% APR or even more; and short-term deposits of more than 3% APR.
Either way, how things have changed in just a few months. At the beginning of the year, ING charged commissions for the Orange Account because its clients left ""too much"" money in the account...
The rest of the features are:
From today the account is remunerated at 1.25% APR, but only for clients with a payroll account, otherwise it will be paid at 0.85% APR


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
325,"Wizink eliminates the 3-month deposit and 3% APR, and extends the rest up to 3.3% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-elimina-el-deposito-al-3-tae-a-3-meses-y-prorroga-el-resto/,01/06/2023,"Wizink has eliminated its deposit with a 3-month term and 3% APR and has extended the other fixed terms of up to 3.3% APR for 1 month plus.
The 3-month deposit was a very interesting product as it was a very short term. It was practically like a current account, but with a profitability that exceeds the most profitable accounts on the market: Sabadell at 2.5% APR or Renault Bank at 2.21% APR.
Now there is only Facto that continues to give 3 months at 3% APR. In fact, this Italian entity reacted to Wizink's new products by increasing the profitability of its fixed terms, including 3 months (see here).
The other fixed deadlines will continue for 1 more month, until June 30, 2023:
The most interesting being the 12-month deposit, a not very long term and being the most profitable that the bank offers.
The characteristics of the products, subject to changes, are:
Recently, the bank raised the profitability of its savings account from 0.5% APR to 1% APR. But this increase only applies to new accounts.
If you already had an account, it will continue at 0.5% APR:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

It will continue to give 2.5% APR in your Online account without conditions and without commissions, and if you also direct a payroll, it will bonus you with €200 net in cash.
This account has 2 buts:
Having 2.5% APR and liquid money, especially at this time, is interesting due to the expectations of more increases. So it is a good candidate to consider if you don't have a phobia of Banco Sabadell, of course.
The account characteristics are:
The offer is exclusively for new clients of the entity and will be valid until July 31, 2023
If you open the account and direct deposit a payroll, pension or receive recurring income, the bank will give you a cash bonus of €200.
The payment of the 200 euros will be made:
The bonus is net. The bank is in charge of paying you the personal income tax withholdings that will be deposited into the Treasury. In reality, the bonus paid by the bank is almost €250.
The offer is exclusively for new clients of the entity and will be valid until July 31, 2023

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
327,Banco BIG leaves thousands of savers in the lurch. Remove your deposit at 4% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/banco-big-deja-en-la-estacada-a-miles-de-ahorradores-quiza-su-deposito-al-4-tae/,31/05/2023,"Banco BIG has removed its 2 welcome deposits of up to 4% APR and leaves thousands of savers without processing their requested deposit for days.
The entity had extended the marketing period until today, May 31, 2023, but today there is no longer a trace of these products on its website.
In this sense, some customers have complained:
We requested more than 1 week ago to contract your deposits, and we have still not received absolutely anything from the bank; and so we assume that there are many people.
We still don't know if the bank will respect the offer of all those we request, but things don't smell very good.
NOTE: those who are pending hiring, today the bank still allows them to do so through the mobile APP.
The deposits in question are:
The deposits currently available in this entity are:
The characteristics of these deposits are:
Big offers the “Big Account”, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:
Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

ING announced 1 week ago for June 1 the increase in the profitability of its Orange Account to 1.25% APR, as long as you have the Payroll Account and meet the conditions, or to 0.85% APR otherwise.
In this way, the characteristics of this account will be:
Orange Bank announced almost 1 month ago a rate increase on your account starting June 1 up to 1.8% APR.
This will be your account:
Banco Sabadell raised its online account to 2.5% APR at the end of April, and its marketing deadline expires today.
What will you offer starting tomorrow? Will you cancel, extend or improve the offer?
In our opinion, the bank will expand it or even improve the offer. During the validity of the last promotion, the deposit war has intensified and banks are increasingly offering more and more profitability.
Sabadell was one of the first to pay well for our money, but now, it is still an outstanding offer, but it is not predominant.
The account characteristics are:
Additionally, if you open the account and direct deposit a payroll, pension or receive recurring income, the bank will give you a cash bonus of €200.
Wizink launched its new interest rates on its deposits of up to 3.3% APR on May 4, setting the marketing deadline until today, May 31.
It is a typical Wizink strategy to set short terms and renew them monthly. So, it is most likely that tomorrow it will be extended for 1 more month.
The amount of requests for their deposits is collapsing their contracting system, and there are quite a few complaints about opening delays.

They are not the best deposits on the market, but they have the advantage that they allow early cancellations and are contractable by all clients.
As the only requirement, the bank asks to have the Self Account current account without commissions:
The current account characteristics are:


Self Bank takes months to make changes to its savings products. We have to go back to the month of October, when I set the profitability of its 4 term deposits that are available to all clients.
This fact contrasts with its activity in the post-summer months and it would not be surprising if it makes changes soon, but it will surely be for the worse.
Self Bank launches another term again, this time for 24 months, but less profitable than the existing ones, at 2.75% APR, which is added to the list of the 3 deposits that the bank had already been offering, which give up to 3 .3% APR.
The lower profitability of the new 2-year deposit is due to the fact that the bank also allows it to be contracted with money that the client already has in the bank, unlike the other 3 that require new money.
Self Bank launches 2 new deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months with returns of up to 3.3% APR and extends the 3-month deposit at 3.05% APR that it had been offering since July.
The 3 deposits do not ask for anything, neither payroll nor linked products, you just have to deposit new money into the bank"

ING is the online bank that has captured the most deposits during the first half of 2023 (3,348 million), according to data from the Bank of Spain.
In fact, it is the online bank with the most money on deposit from savers and with a very large margin. Do you understand now why ING does not increase its deposits more?
Where are those bankers who in times of negative rates came out vehemently saying that if the ECB charges them for putting money in the central bank, they should pass those costs on to clients.
Well, now the ECB pays banks to deposit their money there at 4%. Which banks offer that right now! What are the bankers saying now?

They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
332,Openbank counter-offer: 3% APR for 6 months and 3.2% APR for 12 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/contra-oferta-de-openbank-3-tae-a-6-meses-y-32-tae-a-12-meses-de-plazo/,29/05/2023,"Openbank continues doing its thing. Instead of taking out decent deposits directly for everyone, it is in the shadows offering to its clients to prevent them from leaving for other banks.
It is the typical practice from many years ago: personalized offers, counter-offers, but in the end we all end up finding out, and, therefore, if in the end, you as a client, do not receive a similar offer, you end up sending them away.
Currently, the bank offers 2 such terms:
This offer is without ties, far exceeding the offer for increasing balance and with a 12-month term:
The rest of the conditions are the same as the general offer:
You can see its detailed conditions by clicking here.
The big banks do not want to give in, but in the current situation with the Euribor skyrocketing, people are not stupid.
Why leave the money in Banco Santander or BBVA or CaixaBank if Wizink or Renault Bank or MyInvestor give you at least €200 in interest for every €10,000?
NOTE: This offer is personalized, it does not appear anywhere on your website. You have to call or they will call you if you transfer your money from Openbank to another entity.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
333,EBN continues with its €15 Amazon check to capture deposits: up to 3.2% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-sigue-con-su-cheque-amazon-para-captar-depositos-hasta-32-tae/,26/05/2023,"EBN Banco extended the term of the promotion until May 31, in which it gives away a €15 Amazon check if you contract a fixed term of 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This promotion was launched on May 3 and would initially last until May 17, 2023, but on Monday it announced that it was extending it until the end of the month.
We already talked on one occasion about these checks. It seems like a miracle with which a bank can sell everything (see here), but the reality of this bonus is that it is just crumbs, a rubbish gift.
You see, if you put €10,000 in 1 year at 2.9% APR, that means €290 in interest: 20 times more. And we are talking about the minimum investment and the minimum term.
We savers who look for deposits want to be given interest, the more the better and not stories and checks. But in the end, it doesn't matter a stone...
The EBN interest rate is interesting, but the bad thing is that it does not allow early cancellations, a big drawback for the current situation of increasing rates.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
334,"ING will increase the profitability of the Orange Account in June, up to 1.25% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-subira-en-junio-la-rentabilidad-de-la-cuenta-naranja-hasta-el-125-tae/,25/05/2023,"ING will once again increase the profitability of your Orange Account, now up to 1.25% APR, as long as you have the Payroll Account and meet the conditions, or 0.85% APR otherwise.
This increase will come into force from June 1, 2023 and will be the fourth increase since November, when the entity returned to remunerate this account at 0.3% APR.
In this sense, the bank is communicating to its clients, and on its website you can also see the promotion of this new offer for next week.
The last time the account profitability changed was on April 1, 2023 and it will soon increase again:
However, it is still not competitive, when there are accounts without requirements at 2% APR or even more; and short-term deposits of more than 3% APR.
Either way, how things have changed in just a few months. At the beginning of the year, ING charged commissions for the Orange Account because its clients left ""too much"" money in the account...
The bank offers 2 fixed terms of 1 year and a year and a half:

Yes, the commission-free bank began charging its orange account clients €120 commission since November 2021 if you did not meet any of the following 2 conditions:
Have a payroll account and meet the conditions (domiciliary deposit or monthly transfer of €700).
DO NOT have more than 30,000 euros in the Orange Account.
A stupid decision that tarnished the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
It was only 1 year. We do not know how much money he would charge in commissions, but we do not believe it is a large amount, much less than the loss of prestige, for sure.
According to bank data, in February 2022, 14,000 clients had paid commissions. If we consider these data to be good for that entire year, the bank received €1,680,000 for this concept.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
335,Did Renault Bank fall asleep? extends your savings products for 2 more weeks,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-se-durmio-prorroga-por-2-semana-mas-sus-productos-de-ahorro/,25/05/2023,"A week ago we said that Renault Bank should react because the competition had surpassed it, and they didn't do it, they only extended their products for 1 week.
Today we thought that there would almost certainly be an increase, but instead, the bank has extended the deadline again and this time for 2 weeks, until June 7, 2023.
Its deposit at 3.34% is now clearly surpassed by several entities such as Banco BIG, facto or Wizink.
Your savings account at 2.27% APR, as an account, is still at the top of the ranking, but having very short-term deposits at 3% APR or more, well, it is no longer so attractive.
This offer is already 1 month old and during this time an infinite number of things have happened:
The big drawback of your deposit is that it does not allow early cancellations within 2 years.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

In principle it ended today, but we will have 1 more week to hire it.
It is a great offer with an interest rate that we have not seen for many years, and for a not excessively long term: 6 months.
The offer is in principle for new clients of the bank, but if you are already a client you can call the bank and they will give it to you, at least that was the case when they launched this product (see here).
Banco Big also sells a 3-month term, but it is at 3.5% APR, much less interesting. Less time and less profitability, being a welcome bonus product.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
The contracting period is until May 31, 2023.
Banco Big offers you 3 deposits, whose interest rates have been raised by the bank:
The characteristics of these deposits are:
Big offers the “Big Account”, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:
Big offers the “Big Account”, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:
Banco Big offers an account with Spanish Iban, but it is not under Spanish FGD, but rather Portuguese. It is in the style of ING that operates in Spain as a branch of the parent entity.
In this way, the bank is subject to double regulation.
By the Bank of Spain, because it operates here as a bank branch, which it will supervise in terms of liquidity and transparency, and by the Bank of Portugal, the country where it has its bank file and the FGD.
According to the latest audited data, the entity has a total of 2,277 million net assets, 347.1 million of its own capital and assets under supervision worth 3,401 million euros.
In 2018 they earned 23 million euros.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
337,"Wizink and its warehouse contracting process, is it still poor?",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-y-su-proceso-de-contratacion-de-deposito-sigue-siendo-deficiente/,23/05/2023,"Today we echo an email from one of our users who wanted to contract the 12-month deposit at 3.3% APR from Wizink, and that after 1 week it is still not consolidated.
The deposit in question is one of the best on the market and the best in our opinion, the most appropriate term within the bank's offer:
And the features are:
A 3.3% APR is actually a very good offer, but of course, if the operation is normal.
In this case it is less serious, since it is 1 deposit for 12 months, and 1 week or 2 weeks more or less; but it is not reasonable, but Yes it would be extremely serious in the 3 month deposit.
In this sense, our user tells us:
Good morning,
Last 05-15 I requested to open a 12-month deposit at 3.30% tae in wizink.
Correct balance in account to do so, all papers signed that same day the 15th, in short, all requirements met.
Today, the 23rd, 8 days after requesting it, the deposit remains unopened, so the announced profitability is already in question.
In customer service, they tell you that they have extended the deadline for opening from 4 to 7 business days.
Many entities open your deposit INSTANTLY, but at Wizink they hold your money unnecessarily, with the consequent loss of profitability.
I am considering canceling the contract and giving up.
This is not serious.
Can you contact wizink and open a thread with this? Surely it is happening to more clients, let's see what ""official"" explanation they give you about it?
Thank you.
We contacted the bank and they responded:

Wizink's operation has always been strange:
In the beginning, Wizink had an external company to manage account contracting. We don't know if it continues like this. This intermediation greatly complicated the bank's operations during the contracting process.
Is the same thing happening to you? leave us a comment.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
338,MyInvestor already announces its new deposits at 3% APR for 6 and 12 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/myinvestor-ya-anuncia-sus-nuevos-depositos-al-3-tae-a-6-y-12-meses-de-plazo/,22/05/2023,"MyInvestor already announces on its website its new deposits with a good profitability: 3% APR and adequate terms: 6 and 12 months, in addition to being cancelable.
These products will be available starting next Wednesday, May 24, and the bank advises customers that you can take the money to the account now to have it ready and contract it on the 24th.
In the same way, new interested clients are encouraged to open an account as soon as possible, and in this way, speed up the entire process.
These new deposits will make it difficult for Renault Bank, which will have to say what to do on May 25. Its 2-year deposit at 3.34% APR is increasingly less attractive due to the 2-year term and because it is not cancelable.
Although not so much to the following banks, among others:
Your new deposits will be contractable for all clients and with the following characteristics:
MyInvestor increased the profitability of its savings account to 2% APR in the month of February and increased the maximum remuneration to €50,000.

MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
339,…. and while ING announces this: A fund with a return objective of 2.4% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/y-mientras-ing-anuncia-esto-un-fondo-con-objetivo-de-rentabilidad-del-24-tae/,19/05/2023,"ING has become archaic. Such a dynamic entity for savers, now goes and offers, on its website and on the cover, a 3-year investment fund with a return objective of 2.4% APR.
It was not even attractive during the previous years (2018 or 2022), but now, it is an insult to savers who, without any risk and expense, can get 3% APR and in much shorter terms.
Gentlemen of ING, which is a fund with which it ""intends"" that your clients earn 2.4% APR, which may not be achieved. In fact, even you say it yourself because the law obliges you: ""Investment funds carry the risk of capital loss.""
Furthermore, you advertise that they are available. Yes, of course, but at what price?
Do you know who wins with these funds? The bank, that is, ING. The fund takes 0.6% for the management and deposit of the fund.
Well, little compared to the most profitable ones on the market that reach up to 4% APR. But it is slightly better than the big banks that give nothing.
It gives 1% APR to your Orange account, as long as you have the Payroll Account and meet the conditions, or 0.7% APR otherwise:
And it offers 2 deposits of up to 1.25% APR:
Those of us who have been and know ING, these are not the products we want and have obtained from this entity that used to be one of the best. Now it is mediocre at the bottom.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120

Haitong Bank is a Portuguese entity with a branch in Spain, whose products can be purchased through the Raisin platform.
Taking out a deposit in this bank would be similar to ING: You will have personal income tax withholdings and the bank will communicate your data to the Portuguese Tax Agency and FGD. The only addition is that you must use Raisin as an intermediary.
Its deposits are:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.
Its most interesting deposits, the 6, 9 and 12 month term at 3.1%, 3.2% and 3.6% APR, only surpassed by:
It will exceed MyInvestor's future offer at 3% APR for 6 and 12 months, although in this case it is cancelable.
It is also better than what Wizink offers at 12 months, which is at 3.3% APR, although at 3 months, Wizink is clearly superior: 3% APR.
The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."

It is an account without commissions and without conditions and well remunerated, comparable to the Renault Bank account (2.27% APR).
The offer is aimed at all the bank's clients, but under some selection criteria (Eligible clients must have an N26 personal bank account with Spanish IBAN, have a registered local tax identification number and be a resident of Spain, in addition to others criteria).
According to its website, if you are a customer before May 15, 2023, and you do not see the product in the APP, do not worry, the bank is gradually offering the Savings Account in Spain
Try updating the APP to the latest version and check back in the coming weeks.
The account characteristics are:
The bank's headquarters are German and with a Spanish IBAN. That is, it will apply personal income tax withholdings and everything the same as if it were a Spanish bank, but the FGD is German. It's ING style.


A couple of days ago we tried to find a good alternative to Orange Bank, and it was an almost impossible task (see here). No offer equals that of Orange Bank, much less improves it.
N26 could be a great alternative that we didn't look at a couple of days ago.
ING is the online bank that has captured the most deposits during the first half of 2023 (3,348 million), according to data from the Bank of Spain.
In fact, it is the online bank with the most money on deposit from savers and with a very large margin. Do you understand now why ING does not increase its deposits more?
Where are those bankers who in times of negative rates came out vehemently saying that if the ECB charges them for putting money in the central bank, they should pass those costs on to clients.
Well, now the ECB pays banks to deposit their money there at 4%. Which banks offer that right now! What are the bankers saying now?"
344,"Facto increases the profitability of its deposits up to 3.5% APR from 6 months, 3% at 3 months",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/facto-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-hasta-35-tae-desde-6-meses-3-a-3-meses/,16/05/2023,"New increase in Facto deposits to combat the new offers Wizink (3.3% APR), BFS (3.4% APR), Renault Bank (3.3% APR) or Banco BIG (4% APR).
It now offers from 3 months to 3% APR and 3.5% APR from just 6 months of term for all the bank's clients.
Facto offers that 3.5% APR for up to almost 2 years of term, letting you even choose the day you want the deposit to expire.
These new rates already appear in the calculator on their website, although the old interest rates still apply in the particular conditions.
The downside to these deposits is that they do not allow early cancellations, so we do not recommend long terms.
The most appropriate are those with a term of 3 to 6 months, with 180 days being, we believe, more interesting.
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
345,Banco BIG also offers that 4% APR to existing clients who bring money,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-big-tambien-ofrece-ese-4-tae-a-los-ya-clientes-que-lleven-dinero/,16/05/2023,"A reader of our website and a client of Banco BIG tells us that the entity is also offering the 6-month deposit at 4% APR or the 3-month deposit at 3.5% APR even if you have been a client for more than 3 months.

This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
346,Learn the numbers that appear the most in electronic roulette,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/aprende-los-numeros-que-mas-salen-en-la-ruleta-electronica/,15/05/2023,"Among the favorite games in an online casino is roulette. Classic game that has managed to adapt to new ways to enjoy on mobile devices. However, after the euphoria, many participants evaluate the best way to win.
According to Casino HEX España specialist, Maya Duarte Alvarado, players seek to obtain important information and data that could help them win. And this is possible by knowing which numbers appear most frequently in roulette. For this reason, below, we invite you to learn how to identify the numbers that appear the most times. To build a better strategy when playing.
But, before knowing the hot and cold numbers of a roulette wheel, we invite you to understand certain details and technicalities, such as the randomness of the numbers. Since, the randomness of the numbers is a factor that, according to mathematical analysts, designates a common standard of deviation in the game of roulette. And, to evaluate this factor, the characteristics of the roulette wheel are taken into account.
Thus, the first thing you should evaluate is the type of roulette to play. Where, European roulette has 37 numbers, while American roulette has 38 numbers. Also, keep in mind that, although it may seem that all numbers have the same probability of coming up, this is not actually true.
In this way, it can be obtained as a first conclusion, when observing the results, that the level of variability will increasingly be greater, in relation to the number of times the wheel rotates. So, the more times the wheel is turned, the variability will be reduced.
Which, in the end, we can conclude that the more times we turn the wheel, the more we can obtain an equal level of variability for each number. Therefore, in the end it can be deduced that in roulette there are hot and cold numbers.
Having the certainty that, in the end, a certain amount of number will have come out more frequently than others. Key information for our evaluation of knowing the numbers that appear the most in electronic roulette in online casinos licensed by the DGOJ.
Now, before continuing, you may have doubts about whether these types of theories have application for online platforms. But, even if they are games for technological devices, the theory has the same validity.
Meanwhile, the terms cold and hot numbers are used to assign the numbers that appear more or less frequently on roulette. And, to obtain this evaluation, it would be necessary to know the numbers that have come up during the period of 24 hours of play or during 500 spins.
While, the assignment of these terms, “hot” and “cold”, also refer to numbers that remain active for a certain period of time. Thus, cold numbers are those that do not seem to be active, or that at some point remained hot, reaching a certain streak to be cold.
Furthermore, a clarification must be made. Although over a certain period of time you may notice that some numbers come out more than others, this is no guarantee that the same numbers will stay hot for days.
Now, it's time to participate and take a sample. For this, and if you don't want to wait until 500 spins, it is still possible to get a sample with only 300 spins.
Thus, adapting the details for our evaluation, the number of times a number must come up, to assign it as hot, can be up to 8 times (in a larger sample, the number of times it must come up to be hot is 14). . While cold numbers are recognized because they only appear 3 times.
In this way, with this amount of sample, the amount of fluctuations inherent to randomness can be smoothed out and better results obtained.
Beyond obtaining a first record of hot and cold numbers, the information is also the possibility of developing a strategy for continued work. Thus, you can obtain various dynamic images of the game and make better evaluations.
In reality, it is not a simple task to know which numbers will appear most frequently. But by having this evaluation guide, you will be closer to your goal of winning at roulette.
But, if you still want to hope for luck, you can also select your numbers depending on the fortune myths that are poured into a casino. And, these numbers are:

Little by little this panorama was changing, as the number of people with the intention of becoming miners increased but without the capital to acquire the necessary ASIC equipment.
Hardware creation companies have currently focused on producing equipment with great operating and processing power at lower costs so that all interested parties can have access to them.
When mining bitcoin, the capacity and effectiveness of the hardware equipment used is very important, since the solution of the algorithms and mathematical problems carried out in this activity are very complex, currently the ASIC brand is giving the size proving to be the most capable.
This characteristic makes them favorites for miners, who are looking for good technology and at low costs, which has made mining a more accessible crypto activity and its operability not only with bitcoin but with other cryptocurrencies as well.
ASIC equipment has a disadvantage, which is that it only operates based on mining under a single algorithm model, but the great possibility given this limitation is that many cryptocurrencies can be mined through the distribution of this algorithm, that is, These devices are not limited by this aspect to processing mining with a single type of cryptocurrency.
In the case of the code to mine bitcoin, it can also be used to mine Namecoin, Bitcoin Cash and other cryptocurrencies, this code is known as SHA-256.
Most miners that use ASIC hardware focus on the application of a model algorithm for particular but dedicated bitcoin mining, promoting its good performance.
Bitcoin mining is a complex process, hence its great demand for capacity in physical equipment to carry out this activity. In addition to ASIC, other equipment such as CPU and GPU, with great potential, is also used.
Powerful equipment optimizes the mining market
Mining has been a very favorite activity in the cryptographic environment but very expensive to practice, which is what large physical device production companies have focused on, in terms of providing equipment that can be acquired at a lower price.
The most capable teams are those for mining for bitcoin, the Bitman company spoke out by announcing its new creation and issuance to the market of its Antminer devices model S19 XP, Pro+ and Hyd, which are equipped with great operational potential and costs. Lower.
It is considered that these new devices are capable of achieving mining processing for 150 TH per second, thus achieving a profitability of more than $30 per day, since they have a liquid cooling system that prevents them from overheating and thus being able to continue mining for a long period of time.
The creation and issuance of cryptocurrencies to the market is a strategy that has managed to give a unique and convenient change to the way of global commerce. For more information go to bitqt-app.com

It had been offering the same thing for more than a decade in attracting clients for its Payroll Account.
But the rapid rise in rates in recent months has meant that Bankinter has to give double the bonus to attract new payrolls: It raises the maximum remuneration from €5,000 to €10,000.
Therefore, the bonus will be double (up to €680 instead of €340), logically, the money deposited is also double:
If we take into account, for example, Banco Big that gives you a 4% APR for 6 months, only asking you to be a new customer or Renault Bank that gives a 2.27% APR without asking you for anything. What Bankinter gives is not that big of a deal, since it asks for much more:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, of course, if it meets the following 2 points:
This offer is valid until July 31, 2023.
Bankinter offers until June 30, 2023 its friend plan in which it gives €50 to both the godfather and the godson in addition to remunerating your money at 5% APR during the first year and 2% APR during the second year, in exchange for the domiciliation of a payroll.
As a requirement, the bank requires you to sign up for a Payroll Account (payroll direct debit from €800).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below (enter the email correctly in case the sponsor/godson has to contact you).
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until June 30, 2023.
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."
349,Banco Mediolanum offers a deposit at 4% APR for new customers and a but,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-mediolanum-ofrece-un-deposito-al-4-tae-para-nuevos-clientes-y-un-pero/,12/05/2023,"Banco Mediolanum offers a deposit at 4% APR for 6 months for new clients, the same as Banco Big, but it has a big ""but"".
This entity requires that you have managed assets of at least €3,000 as of the deposit expiration date or have a payroll or pension deposited directly (minimum €700) at the end of the month prior to the deposit expiration.
It would be a great offer if Banco Big hadn't launched its own (see here). But for existing Banco Big clients it is a good alternative.
It really asks that you have a payroll the month before the deposit closes, but it does not indicate that you have to maintain the payroll for a certain time (without permanence).
The characteristics of the deposit are:
This offer will be valid until June 30, 2023 or until the availability of 15 million euros for new bank customers is exhausted.
>> More details about the deposit


Banco Mediolanum has increased the profitability of its Accounts to 2% APR, but like its deposit at 2% APR, it is not worth it.
They are temporary profitability, exclusively for new clients and for a limited amount.
Banco Mediolanum launches a customer acquisition deposit, offering a 2% APR for 6 months to the entity's new customers.
It becomes the most profitable deposit of Spanish banks, surpassing EBN Banco (1.75% APR)
According to the CEO of Banco Santander, José Antonio Alvarez, the entity is planning to charge for non-operational accounts (without movements), but always from companies and large corporations.
On the other hand, the interest rate on deposits continues to fall, and there are fewer and fewer options for savers. We indicate the best deposits."
350,Deposit war: 10 banks fight to capture your liquidity,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/guerra-de-depositos-10-bancos-luchan-por-captar-tu-liquidez/,11/05/2023,"With what has happened in recent weeks/months we can now say that the deposit war has returned, but only for small entities. The big ones like Santander, BBVA or Caixa Bank remain on the sidelines.
The only exception is Banco Sabadell, which has long been offering one of the most profitable accounts on the market (2.5% APR for 12 months for new customers, see here), but nothing more.
Bankinter continues with its Payroll Account at 5% APR. It's been doing the same thing for more than a decade. It only timidly appears with an account at 1% APR without commissions and without conditions (see here)
Before entering into the comparison, we want to review the 2 Banco Big deposits at 4% APR and 3.5% APR for 6 and 3 months respectively.
We left their offer out of the comparison as they are welcome deposits, but they are interesting products to take into account if you are not yet a customer of the bank. They are the most profitable on the market and the 6-month one is especially interesting.
Also worth noting, in addition to the Banco Sabadell account already mentioned, is the MyInvestor savings account at 2% APR, which does not appear in the following comparative table as it is again a welcome offer:
*: The BFS term is 25 months and we have compared it with 24 months.
*: TargoBank has a 4% early cancellation penalty fee, but it is limited to the interest generated.
Observations:
If you think rates will continue to rise, choose a short-term deposit. Banco BIG is a great option if you are not yet a customer; Wizink or Facto would be the other alternatives. Savings accounts should also be taken into consideration: Sabadell, Reanault Bank, TargoBank or Pibank.
If you think that rates will not rise much more, I would choose terms between 1 to 3 years (as long as you are not going to need the money in that time). This way you guarantee good profitability for a long time. If you went with this option, you would choose cancelable deposits like Wizink, Pibak or BFS.
…and you, what do you think? Leave us a comment below.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
351,NN Bank online account temporarily unavailable for contracting,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/la-cuenta-online-de-nn-bank-temporalmente-no-disponible/,10/05/2023,"We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account.
In 2018, NN Bank fully began attracting customers with savings accounts, offering a return of 0.3% APR, without commissions and without limits.
Its profitability is only surpassed by Banco Pichincha (0.5% APR) and some foreign entity such as FerratumBank (0.6% APR) and few others, and equals what Wizink and COINC offer.
It seemed that it wanted to be the successor of ING, with whom it went hand in hand, offering what ING no longer provided; but it takes time, which is surpassed by ING's offer, which is not at all good.
Today we have seen on its website that it is ""temporarily"" off-market. Will it be to return more aggressive or will it be for its definitive closure? We will see.
The characteristics of your account until recently were:
Unlike ING, NN Bank does not have a branch in Spain, so it has the following drawbacks:
Of course, the bank does offer telephone customer service in perfect Spanish (with the feeling that we have spoken with ING) and a website also in our language.


NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
In 2018 we welcomed NN Bank as a possible successor to ING by offering profitability on the accounts as much as ING charged for storing its clients' money.
But in 2022, things have changed, even ING has returned to profitability in its account, but NN Bank continues without making any changes, it remains at its 0.2% APR. To return to?"

The increase has been 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 percentage points in the respective deposits, until reaching the 3% APR bar.
These products are aimed at new customers or money coming from other entities.
We could have highlighted this new offer more, but it has been somewhat overshadowed by Wizink's increase in its cancelable deposits, reaching up to 3.3% APR and in shorter terms.
Also by Banco Big, which from today offers a 4% APR for 6 months. Of course, it plays in a different league, because it is only for new clients. However, TargoBank allows clients to contract it with external money.
But it is undoubtedly a great offer, one more alternative for savers, especially those who do not like Wizink or other offers. That is your choice.
The other characteristics of these deposits are:
In order to contract these deposits you need to open an account at TargoBank.
>> See more information about deposits
Recently, TargoBank raised the profitability of Cuenta Próxima to 1% APR:
The bad thing is that the bank asks that you meet one of the following 3 requirements to NOT pay commissions:
If you do not meet one of these 3 requirements, you will have to pay €8 per month in account maintenance fees.
The bank gives you a few months of grace, the account being exempt from commissions: the month of contracting and the following 3, even if you do not meet any of the conditions.

Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
TargoBank continues to offer its Amigo Plan, in which the client (sponsor) and the new client (sponsor) can each get €30 for signing up for the Next Account, a PRIME Subscription Account and/or a fixed-term deposit.
The Targo Bank Next Account has a very interesting interest rate, 2.53% APR, an interest rate set in the month of June.
Increase in the profitability of the Targo Bank Next Account, up to 2.53% APR, surpassing Renautl Bank (2.27% APR), N26 (2.26% APR) and similar to Banco Sabadell (2.5% TAE).
That 2.53% APR is for any amount of money, as long as you leave €100 in the payment account and without an upper limit."

Everything is decent in this product and with almost no tricks (just ask that you be a new customer): 6 month period and minimum amount of €10,000 and maximum of €75,000.
It also offers another deposit for new customers, which we think is much worse: 3 months at 3.5% APR. Less time and less profitability, being a welcome bonus product.

354,Does Facto lose hegemony or is it still your option despite Wizink?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/facto-pierde-la-hegemonia-o-sigue-siendo-vuestra-opcion-a-pesar-de-wizink/,08/05/2023,"Until last Friday, May 4, the Facto offer was the preferred option of many savers or at least the most profitable.
Between their 2.5% APR at 3 months to wait for more increases or their deposits from 12 months to 36 months at 3.25% APR, to guarantee good profitability for a long time, they stood out in our ranking.
But something has changed recently.
Facto offers its deposit for 3 months and at 2.5% APR since March. Only with the passing of the days, the rest of the banks have become closer.
It was more profitable than the Renault Bank Savings account, at 2.27% APR. He hasn't been offering this for long. He uploaded it recently at the end of April; Before it was at 1.81% APR.
There is also Sabadell, but it did not offer the 2.5% APR until the end of April, and furthermore, it is a product only for new customers.
Others further behind are: MyIvestor at 2% APR, Orange Bank at 1.6% (they will raise it on June 1 to 1.81% APR), Pibank at 1.51% APR.
Some of you will say that they are all accounts and what Facto offers is a deposit. True, the accounts are available immediately, and the Facto deposit is 3 months. But it is such a short time that we believe we can compare it within the framework of short-term products. It is not a comparison of accounts.
But Friday, May 4, arrived, and Wizink goes and takes out a 3-month deposit at 3% APR. Beating Facto by half a percentage point.
Facto offers a wide range of fixed terms. You can even choose how many days you want your deposits to last, always starting from 90 and less than 1827 days. That has not changed.
In fact, it gives you 2.5% APR from 3 months to 6 months. After 180 days, the bank raises you up to 2.75% APR.
There was no one who gave as much to these terms either... but a new Wizink deposit for 3 months and at 3% APR is better, we believe.
We consider a decent term, no more than 12 months. We believe there is still a long way to go in rate increases.
But if you don't think that way, and that they will no longer rise, longer-term deposits are better to guarantee good profitability for a long time, as long as that time does not exceed your expectation that you will need the money.
As of 12 months, Facto offers at 3.25% APR, an offer that has recently been matched (April) by Renault Bank (3.34% APR) and is now surpassed by Wizink at 3.3% APR.
It's a small difference, but Wizink allows you to cancel early, and that changes everything.
Facto has dominated the deposit market since March, but has now lost many points with the latest changes.
If Facto wants to continue being pilloryed, it needs an urgent update. Or maybe not?
The opinions of the clients of both entities are clearly favorable to Facto. Because?
De Facto has little or no complaints, but from Wizink…
Starting last Friday, it created a huge mess with its 3 websites, each one a thing (see here). They fixed it pretty quickly though.
But the worst are the messages and comments from users. They emphasize the hiring process and the lack of customer service and problem resolution.
We have collected some:
And so it goes on. You can read it in the latest articles about Wizink.
And yes, there are also some good comments about the bank, we have found 1 in the same articles published recently:
It is up to you which bank to choose. We only tell you the facts. What is your opinion? leave us a comment.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
355,"BFS increases the profitability of all its deposits, offering a maximum of 3.4% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-sube-todos-sus-depositos-ofreciendo-el-34-tae-como-maximo/,05/05/2023,"BFS also increases the profitability of its deposits, and does so on all its fixed terms, especially on deposits that allow early cancellation, reaching up to 3.4% APR.
In addition, it has launched a non-cancelable 36-month fixed term. Thus, the bank has 4 fixed terms: 12, 18, 25 and 36 months and in 2 modalities: cancelable and non-cancellable.
Its most profitable products, those that DO NOT allow early cancellation, which reaches up to 3.4% APR.
These deposits have a premium of between 0.5 and 0.6 percentage points more than those that can be canceled for the same term, which give up to a maximum of 2.8% APR.
We don't really like non-cancelable deposits, especially if we have terms of more than 1 year. Too long given how rates are evolving. We believe it will still continue to rise.
Despite this increase, it is still in the deposits:
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until May 7, 2023, and are exclusively for new contributions.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
356,"Orange Bank will rise to 1.8% APR starting June 1, 2023",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-subira-hasta-el-18-tae-a-partir-de-1-de-junio-de-2023/,04/05/2023,"Orange Bank is informing its clients that on June 1 it will increase the profitability of their savings account to 1.8% APR from 1.5% APR.
We believe that an increase is insufficient, as there are other banks such as Renault Bank that gives 2.27% APR or Wizink that offers 3-month deposits at 3% APR.
Furthermore, it is an increase that will not take effect for another 1 month. Many will have left the bank before that date.
This 1.8% APR will only be for customers with an Orange line, and those who contracted the account before December 19, 2022. Before that date, the account was only contractable by savers with an Orange line, even if it later ceased to have a contract. with the mobile company.
New customers without an Orange line will have to settle for a 1.6% APR, compared to the current 1.3% APR.
Thus, the account will have the following characteristics starting next month:
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.
On December 19, Orange Bank allows you to open an account without the need for an Orange mobile line. But these customers will receive 0.8% APR instead of 1% APR. Former customers maintain the 1% APR.
On March 1, the bank raised it to 1.5% (Orange clients) and 1.3% APR (without Orange line).
In 1 month, it will go to 1.8% and 1.5% APR.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
357,Mess in Wizink offers: each Wizink website says a different thing,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/lio-en-las-ofertas-de-wizink-cada-web-de-wizink-dice-una-cosa-diferente/,04/05/2023,"Today, May 4, the new wizink deposits of up to 3.3% APR come into force and become the most profitable on the market.
However, different areas of the Wizink website show different things.
On Wizink's main public website (www.wizink.es) it shows that it markets 4 deposits:

On the website that normally advertises deposits (depositowizink.com), the bank shows 3 deposits:

But most importantly, in the customer area, the bank continues to show the old 3 deposits:

As always, the operation of the Wizink websites and its product contracting system have been and continue to be deficient.
Let's hope they correct this disparity soon. The bank has been generating this expectation for 2 weeks, and they are not able to have the deployment of their website ready with all the offer correctly.
NOTE: Today, May 8, the 3 websites already show the same 4 deposits that we have commented on in the last articles.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
358,EBN increases its deposits up to 3.20% APR and gives away €15 in Amazon check,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-sube-hasta-320-tae-sus-depositos-y-regala-15e-en-cheque-amazon/,03/05/2023,"EBN Banco increases its deposits again, although very slightly. As a novelty, if you contract a fixed term for 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, the bank will give you a €15 Amazon check.
However, the largest rate increase affects terms of less than 1 year. Specifically, for 6 and 9 months, with an increase of 0.45 and 0.40 percentage points.
The 12-month term has also experienced a good increase, of 0.35 percentage points, and also benefits from the €15 Amazon check.
The bad thing about this bank, like others, is that it does not allow early cancellations of its deposits, so we have to forget about its long terms; Therefore, the 12-month period is especially interesting.
As a criticism, we savers who look for deposits want to be given interest, the more the better and not stories and checks. But in the end, it doesn't matter a stone...
The offer is valid until May 17, 2023:
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
359,Openbank offers a deposit at 3% APR and 6 months in a personalized way,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/openbank-ofrece-un-deposito-al-3-tae-y-a-6-meses-de-forma-personalizada/,03/05/2023,"Openbank returns to the practice of banks from years ago, making counter-offers to prevent capital flight towards entities with more profitable deposits such as Wizink or Renault Bank.
In this specific case, our regular user VMAD has told us (thank you very much), that when trying to transfer his funds from Openbank to Wizink to contract his new deposits of up to 3.3% APR, Openbank has called him to offer him 2 deposits to retain him :
This offer is without ties, far exceeding the offer for increasing balance and with a 12-month term:
The rest of the conditions are the same as the general offer:
You can see its detailed conditions by clicking here.
The big banks do not want to give in, but in the current situation with the Euribor skyrocketing, people are not stupid.
Why leave the money in Banco Santander or BBVA or CaixaBank if Wizink or Renault Bank or MyInvestor give you at least €200 in interest for every €10,000?


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
360,Clarifications on the offer coming from Wizink starting tomorrow,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/aclaraciones-sobre-la-oferta-que-viene-de-wizink-a-partir-de-manana/,03/05/2023,"Starting tomorrow there will be a new Wizink offer on your deposits with the launch of 2 terms of 3 and 12 months with excellent returns of 3% APR and 3.3% APR respectively, but there are some doubts that we want to clarify here.
The current 18, 25 and 36 month deposits will remain unchanged, at 3.00% APR, 2.30% APR and 2.50% APR respectively.
All these deposits will be contractable by all clients: new and old, but it must be ""formalized from the Web, not from the App.""
You must access the Customer Area of ​​the entity's website, in the ""global position"", clicking on the section that indicates ""My Savings"", ""Do you want to Save?"" Start now"".
The origin of the capital to be deposited can be from an account outside of Wizink (the bank is responsible for debiting the indicated amount) or from a Wizink Savings account.
Once your request is confirmed, you will receive an email to proceed with signing the contract, indicating the steps you must follow.
If no additional information or documentation is required, which if so will be required by email, within a period of approximately 5 business days you will receive another email confirming the opening of the Deposit.
Once the deposit is formalized, the system automatically opens a savings account linked to it; it is in that account where the interest generated by the deposit will be paid quarterly.
No, the 1% APR is only given on accounts that have NOT been linked to a deposit.
So if you want the 1% APR, you must sign up for a new account, and it can be opened by both existing clients and new clients.
It's really stupid, but that's how Wizink works strangely. In the end you end up with a bunch of useless accounts.
NOTE: our eternal gratitude to VMAD, for forwarding us the Wizink email that clarifies some doubts about these products.

The 3-month deposit is a very short-term deposit, practically like a checking account, but with a much higher profitability, up to 3% APR. It even surpasses Facto's offer, which gives that term at 2.5% APR, and the most profitable accounts: Sabadell at 2.5% APR or Renault Bank at 2.21% APR.
The 12-month deposit, a not very long term and for which Wizink lacked an offer, will be the most profitable for that term, surpassing Facto, BFS, EBN….

362,Online loans on the spot without requirements: how to obtain financing without work,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/prestamos-online-en-el-acto-sin-requsitos-como-obtener-financiamiento-sin-trabajo/,28/04/2023,"In a loan application, employment verification is a process in which the lender verifies the applicant's employment information. This process helps lenders evaluate the risk of granting a loan to a given individual. If a lender requires verification of employment, the applicant will generally be asked to provide detailed information about their current or previous employer, including length of employment and income.
For those who are currently unemployed, it may seem difficult to obtain a loan. However, there are online loan options in Spain that do not require employment verification. These loans can be obtained quickly and without the need to provide employment documentation.
In this article, we will explore how these loans work and how to qualify for them. We will also discuss some alternatives to online loans without employment verification for those who may not qualify.
When applying for a loan, one of the first things traditional lenders typically ask for is employment verification. However, this can be an obstacle for those who do not have a stable job or a verifiable source of income. This is where online loans without employment verification can be an attractive option for borrowers.
Some of the reasons some borrowers prefer these types of loans include the ease and speed of application, lack of employment verification requirements, and the ability to obtain funds quickly. Despite these advantages, it is important to note that online loans without employment verification may also have higher interest rates and less favorable terms. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate all options before making a decision.
If you're looking for an online loan with no employment verification or no-requirements on-the-spot loans, it's important to know that some lenders may require income verification instead of employment verification. While these lenders may not require proof of employment, they will still require that you have a regular income to qualify for the loan.
Additionally, online lenders that offer loans without employment verification may have other eligibility requirements, such as a strong credit history, an active bank account, and a valid email address.
To improve your chances of qualifying for an online loan without employment verification, consider obtaining a copy of your credit report to make sure there are no errors or issues that could affect your credit score. Additionally, you may consider adding a co-signer or co-signer with verifiable income to help increase your chances of approval.
Remember that while online loans without employment verification can be an attractive option, you should consider the potential risks and costs associated with these loans before making a decision. Be sure to carefully read the loan terms and conditions and compare interest rates and fees with other lenders before committing to an online loan without employment verification.
To find reliable lenders that offer online loans without employment verification, it is important to research and compare different online options.
A good option is to use an online loan comparison service like Crezu, which allows you to compare different lenders and their loan offers without having to carry out employment verifications.
Additionally, you can also search online for reviews and testimonials from other users to evaluate the trustworthiness of each lender. It is also important to check if the lender is registered and authorized to operate in your country or region.
While online loans without employment verification can be a good option for people who do not have a job, it is also important to know some alternatives that can be useful:
Remember that it is always important to carefully read the terms and conditions of any no-holds-barred loan or financial assistance program before accepting it. Additionally, you must be responsible when using the money and make sure you can keep up with the payments.
In times of economic uncertainty, many people in the United States are looking for quick and affordable financial solutions. Car title loans have emerged as a popular option, offering individuals the opportunity to get cash quickly, using their vehicle as collateral."

Coming out of a terrible scenario experienced last year, digital currencies have managed to adopt an upward trend currently, to the point of once again managing to regain more than a billion in market capitalization, which had vanished after the fall. from the FTX exchange platform.
BTC is the cryptocurrency that has managed to lead the way in the price increases of digital currencies, with the intention of positioning itself in the best culmination of the beginning of the year with a very high percentage value, after spending more than 10 years without any type. such a significant rebound.
According to expert analyzes and their conclusions, some users assure that the worst moment of cryptocurrencies is already behind them, while on the other hand a large part of users consider that the catastrophe of the crypto world is just beginning and its maximum fall will be transcendental.
Many aspects suffered can be considered as tangible characteristics of the lowest declines in cryptocurrencies such as organizational reconversions, compliance with bankruptcy processes and various market indicators give evidence of the presence of crypto winter.
It is very interesting to see the interest shown by investors despite the falls of such important platforms in this environment, causing a large number of unemployment, situations that have not diminished the desire to return to the market and crypto trading, despite the eminent dangers that this entails.
The optimism of the largest population living in the crypto market is due to the scoops on the economy, issued in recent months, where the decrease in inflation during December 2022 had the greatest importance and impact on thinking. of the users.
This good news has managed to foster faith in the markets, since there is confidence that the measures to be taken by the Fed will reduce the high cost of interest
The confidence shown by investors in cryptocurrencies also stems largely from the abrupt rise of bitcoin, causing an immediate equal effect on the other currencies in the digital market, which has been considered a positive indicator, in addition to the interaction of the markets in equities, where the lowest indicator represents the soon appearance of an upward trend.
This regulatory entity and defender of balance in the world economy has maintained its firm stance regarding the battle to reduce inflation rates, to improve the possibilities of trade and profitability in the markets.

But what changes the most is that Abanca requires payroll for everything, both for the account paid at 2% APR and for the cash bonus.
Sabadell gives you 2.5% APR for €30,000 just by opening your online account, without further ado. This is the big difference.
2% APR
€300 net cash:
Offer valid until June 30, 2023.
The Clara Online Account is a pack with the following services:
This online account supports up to two account holders. And each client can have a maximum of two Clara Online Accounts in ABANCA.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

In fact, its subsidiary, Evo Banco, has been more aggressive and has raised its Smart account to 2% APR, yes, for a maximum of €30,000 and you must have €4,000 in the unpaid checking account.
But it is nothing comparable to what Banco Sabadell and its Online Account are giving at 2.5% APR, which has broken the market. Will we see Santander and BBVA move soon? Hopefully.
The Sin account is an online account that can be contracted by new clients and that remunerates you at 1% APR, without limits and for an indefinite period.
The characteristics of this account are:
Offer available until June 30, 2023 for new customers who sign up for the account through bankinter.com.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."

It therefore becomes the most profitable account on the market. MyInvestor, Sabadell, Evo Banco, Facto, and even Wizink's future 3% APR 3-month deposit will have to reconsider their offer in view of this change by Sabadell.
In any case, we have to point out that this account has 2 buts:
Additionally, if you keep a payroll, the bank gives you €200 (previously it was €250). It no longer requires that you be one of the first 20,000 new customers, it gives it to all new customers.
Having 2.5% APR and liquid money, especially at this time, is very appropriate due to the expectations of further increases. So it is a good candidate to consider if you don't have a phobia of Banco Sabadell, of course.
The account characteristics are:
The offer is exclusively for new clients of the entity and will be valid until May 31, 2023
If you open the account and direct deposit a payroll, pension or receive recurring income, the bank will give you a cash bonus of €200.
The payment of the 200 euros will be made:
The bonus is net. The bank is in charge of paying you the personal income tax withholdings that will be deposited into the Treasury. In reality, the bonus paid by the bank is almost €250.
The offer is exclusively for new clients of the entity and will be valid until May 31, 2023

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
369,MyInvestor also offers its account at 2% APR to clients who bring new money,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/myinvestor-ofrece-su-cuenta-al-2-tae-tambien-a-clientes-que-lleve-dinero-nuevo/,20/04/2023,"MyInvestor is also offering a 2% APR return on its savings account for the money of existing clients.
What is clear is that if the ECB pays the banks for the money deposited in it (deposit facility), 3%, everything it can capture for less is a great deal for the bank.
This is being done by small and medium-sized entities in Spain that try to raise money via deposits and bank accounts, unlike large banks, such as Santander and BBVA, which seem to receive the money as punishment and without paying anything in return. .
In this case, MyInvestor is sending an email to its clients offering them 2% APR for 1 years:
The bank clarifies that:
The total remuneration of the account is applied up to a maximum of 50,000 euros at the rate corresponding to each tranche (what was until January 31, 0.3% APR, and the new, 2% APR) From this amount , will not be remunerated.
NOTE: Only new money that you have added to the account in the months of February and March benefit from this promotion. It is only an improvement in conditions, without you being able to deposit more money and benefit from this improvement in the interest rate.

MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
370,Wizink will exceed in May: 3% APR at 3 months and 3.3% APR at 12 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-se-superara-en-mayo-3-tae-a-3-meses-y-33-tae-a-12-meses/,19/04/2023,"Wizink has announced in a statement that it will launch on May 4 a 3-month deposit at 3% APR and another 12-month deposit at 3.3% APR, surpassing any offer on the market.
The 3-month deposit is a very short-term deposit, practically like a checking account, but with a much higher profitability, up to 3% APR. It even surpasses Facto's offer, which gives that term at 2.5% APR.
Another weakness that Wizink had is that it lacked a 12-month deposit, but it will correct this, and will give a 3.3% APR, and will be the most profitable at that term, surpassing Facto, BFS, EBN….
So, in a couple of weeks, your offer will look like this:
The characteristics of Wizink deposits are:
Recently, the bank raised the profitability of its savings account from 0.5% APR to 1% APR.
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.



Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
371,"3 Savings Accounts at 2% APR: Myinvestor, Sabadell and Evo Banco",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/3-cuentas-de-ahorro-al-2-tae-myinvestor-sabadell-y-evo-banco/,19/04/2023,"MyInvestor, Sabadell and Evo Banco currently offer their savings account at 2% APR for a term of 12 months to new customers.
This profitability is extraordinary, since the most profitable deposits only exceed it by a little more than 1 percentage point, in exchange for blocking your money for 1 year or more.
Plus, he doesn't ask for anything in return. No payroll, no ties. Just sign up, everything is free and 2% APR for your money.
The downside, to put some to these accounts, is that they limit the maximum to be paid:
Oh, and also, after this initial period, what it offers is little, but everything can change within 1 year:
Thus, MyInvestor and Evo Banco have, so to speak, life after the initial period of high profitability. Sabadell only offers profitability to new customers.
Initially, we wrote that one of the negative points of Evo Banco is that you had to put €4,000 in the checking account, so that the rest of the money would go to the savings account.
But after reading the account documentation, we had a question: what happens to the €4,000 in the checking account? We were not very clear about it, and we deleted that section before publishing.
But after Tino's comment, we added this section.
The smart account is actually 2 connected accounts. A checking account at 0% APR and a savings account at 2% APR (new customers).
When the checking account exceeds €4,000, the money is automatically transferred to the savings account on the 15th of each month, and that money will be remunerated at 2% APR and up to a maximum of €30,000.
Our question: What happens if once you have put the €30,000 in the savings account, you withdraw money from the checking account?
The Evo Banco documentation does not leave anything clear to you.
The 3 entities are under the Spanish FGD, they allow you to make free transfers (in the case of Evo Banco the immediate ones are also free, and MyInvestor does not have that service) and they give you a card that is also free of charge.
When withdrawing cash:
In this section it seems that the most versatile is Evo Banco.
Banco Sabadell offers you a welcome €250 if you direct a payroll (see more details here)


The 3 big banks, famous for their high commissions (along with CaixaBank), sell an account, one online, No Commissions and No Conditions.
First it was BBVA, then Santander imitated it, and now Sabadell. No bank asks for anything in return and gives you an account without charges, a lot to say in these 3 entities.
Let's compare the 3 accounts...
According to the financial consultancy Alvarez & Marsal, which has carried out an examination of Spanish banks with data from the fourth quarter of 2018, the banks with the best grades are Abanca, Kutxabank, Bankinter and BBVA.
The worst: Bankia, Sabadell and Ibercaja
In the month of October, Banco Sabadell suffered a significant flight of deposits due to the legal uncertainty created by the situation in Catalonia, which made it change its headquarters to Alicante.
Now the bank intends to collect money from its clients to recover around 1,000 million euros in deposits through one-on-one calls to its clients to offer a deposit at 0.75% APR."
372,TargoBank raises its cancelable deposits to 2.6% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/targobank-sube-hasta-26-tae-sus-depositos-cancelables/,18/04/2023,"TargoBank increases the profitability of its 3 fixed-term deposits of 12, 18 and 24 months to 2.6% APR.
The increase has been 0.1 percentage points in all deposits, now offering 2.4%, 2.5% and 2.6% APR.
This good profitability is accompanied by the option of allowing early cancellations if necessary, the penalty for which is limited to the interest generated, making it very interesting for savers.
These products are aimed at new clients or money coming from other entities:
To put it in perspective, other cancelable and very profitable deposits are those of Wizink:
Targo Bank wins except for the 18-month deposit. Although really the product we recommend is the 12 month one. In that case, Targo Bank at 2.4% APR is a very good deal.
The other characteristics of these deposits are:
In order to contract these deposits you need to open an account at TargoBank.
>> See more information about deposits
Recently, TargoBank raised the profitability of Cuenta Próxima to 1% APR:
The bad thing is that the bank asks that you meet one of the following 3 requirements to NOT pay commissions:
If you do not meet one of these 3 requirements, you will have to pay €8 per month in account maintenance fees.
The bank gives you a few months of grace, the account being exempt from commissions: the month of contracting and the following 3, even if you do not meet any of the conditions.

Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
TargoBank continues to offer its Amigo Plan, in which the client (sponsor) and the new client (sponsor) can each get €30 for signing up for the Next Account, a PRIME Subscription Account and/or a fixed-term deposit.
The Targo Bank Next Account has a very interesting interest rate, 2.53% APR, an interest rate set in the month of June.
Increase in the profitability of the Targo Bank Next Account, up to 2.53% APR, surpassing Renautl Bank (2.27% APR), N26 (2.26% APR) and similar to Banco Sabadell (2.5% TAE).
That 2.53% APR is for any amount of money, as long as you leave €100 in the payment account and without an upper limit."
373,"Cetelem also offers a 2% APR account, without limits and without conditions.",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/celetem-tambien-ofrece-una-cuenta-al-2-tae/,17/04/2023,"Cetelem, the commercial brand of BNP Paribas, has launched an account at 2% APR for new clients without conditions, without limits, for an indefinite period and totally liquid.
This is how its CEO in Spain explained it (see video here). Just for having the account they give you 2% APR.
It represents an improvement in conditions with respect to MyInvestor or Banco Sabadell, since it gives that 2% APR for an indefinite period of time and without an investment limit, in addition to offering services.
Your objective with this account is to raise liquidity to finance your loans. Try to raise money from citizens instead of the wholesale market.
Additionally, it offers you a free checking account and debit card and allows you to make free transfers, direct debit of bills, payroll or pension at no cost.
You can make free withdrawals at more than 7,000 ATMs from networks with an agreement (Grupo Caja Rural, Cajamar, Euro Automatic Cash and Cardtronics).


Due to the disappearance of Orange Bank, and the transfer of clients to Cetelem, the first ""unknown"" problems of this entity appear.
Today we echo a complaint from one of our users and new Cetelem client who complains about the maximum limit that the entity allows in daily transfers.
This limit, of €30,000, is considered insufficient, and that the entity should modify or remove.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
374,Evo Banco will raise its Smart Account to 2% APR tomorrow only for new customers,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/evo-banco-subira-hasta-el-2-tae-su-cuenta-inteligente-solo-para-nuevos-clientes/,13/04/2023,"Tomorrow, April 14, Evo Banco will increase the profitability of its Smart Account up to 2% APR, but it will only be for new customers and for a maximum of €30,000.
Clients will continue with the 1.1% APR that the bank has been offering since April 3 and always conditional on meeting any linkage requirement. Otherwise, the profitability drops to 0.7% APR.
New customers who register from April 14 to July 31, 2023 will have the account at 2% APR until July 31, 2024, when it will be readjusted to the current rate for all customers.
This is an extra bonus for at least 1 year, although the investment is very limited, less than €30,000.
Remuneration is given without requiring ties, and with liquid money.
Evo Banco remunerates the Smart Account of the bank's clients with a 1.1% APR as long as you meet 1 of the following 2 requirements:
Otherwise, the account is remunerated at 0.7% APR.
We remind you that the Smart Account is 2 accounts:
The rest of the features are:
It is the bank's strong point, allowing free debit withdrawals from more than 16,000 ATMs with no minimum amount and no withdrawal limit:
You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €120.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."
375,Banco Big increases the profitability of customer deposits to 1.85% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/banco-big-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-los-depositos-contratables-por-clientes/,13/04/2023,"Bango Big has increased the profitability of its term deposits for its existing clients, now offering up to 1.85% APR for 1 year term.
Their most profitable products are for new clients, to whom they offer 2% APR for 3 months and 2.5% APR for 6 months, which have remained unchanged since the beginning of March.
The increase in customer deposits has been quite considerable, but they are still not very attractive if we have competition (Fact for example: 2.5% APR from a 3-month term).
Specifically, these products remain as follows:
The characteristics of these deposits are:
Banco Big offers 2 products to new customers, a fixed term of 6 months and another of 3 months with a higher profitability than customer deposits:
The other features are the same as customer deposits. Limits between €10,000 and €75,000, with interest payment due and early cancellation permitted.
Banco Big maintains its “Big Account” unchanged, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR:
Banco Big must do something with this account... because right now it is not competitive at all.
Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

This offer is for 2 weeks, valid until April 25, 2023.

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

377,"Raisin deposits already exceed 4% APR, are they worth it? comparative",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/depositos-raisin-ya-supera-el-4-tae-merece-la-pena-comparativa/,11/04/2023,"Currently, the most profitable deposits that can be contracted in Spain slightly exceed 3% APR, however on the Raisin platform, they go beyond 4% APR. Worth?
Specifically, Raisin offers deposits of up to 4.14% APR through Banca Sistema, but it is a fixed term of 5 years. Not advisable. It lasts forever and is not cancelable.
Continuing with what we have been indicating, that the longest term that we must contract at this time is 1 year (see comparison). Raisin offers a maximum of 3.45% APR from Banca Sistema for this term, followed by Haitong at 3.32% APR.
Well, we want to highlight Haitong's products, because it offers little less than Banca Sistema, but this bank has a branch in Spain.
Haitong only uses Raisin as an intermediary, but the deposit will be in a branch in Spain, it will withhold personal income tax and the interest generated will appear directly on the income tax return.
In short, it is as if you contracted a deposit at ING or if you have an account at Orange Bank, except for the FGD, which is Portuguese.
And if we compare it with deposits without Raisin intervention, for that term the maximum rate is given by Facto at 3.25% APR, an Italian entity with a branch in Spain.
Therefore, both entities offer practically the same thing and their features are more or less similar.
Well, Raisin's most profitable deposits are also provided by Haitong. On the other hand, deposits outside of Raisin are given by Facto. Let's compare:
As you can see, both entities offer more or less the same; highlighting Facto within 3 months.
The most profitable Raisin savings account is offered by Lea Bank at 1.87% APR or Banca Proggeto at 1.75% APR. They are Entities without a branch in Spain.
As you already know, yesterday we made a comparison of the most profitable savings accounts (see here) that give up to 2% APR.
The Haitong and Facto deposits are very similar. I would choose either of the 2 if you are a new customer. If you are already a client of one: Raisin or Facto, then I wouldn't move.
For savings accounts, I would go straight to Renault Bank or perhaps take advantage of the limited time offers from Sabadell or MyInvestor. Why use an intermediary (Raisin) to obtain less profitability and on top of that put the money abroad and with what it implies.
You? Leave us a comment below.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

Several entities have put their accounts at this profitability or even higher.
Since the last ranking of best accounts we did, there have been important changes:
Thus, the Sabadell and MyInvestor accounts continue to dominate the market with a 2% APR (with restrictions), and a third party has emerged, Norwegian (with its drawbacks).
The only one that is clean of dust and straw is Renault Bank, and its 1.81% APR. It is for an indefinite period and without any requirement or restriction. We could even name you as the winner of the comparison.
Pibank, after its last rise (it's about time), is in the middle table.
Without further ado, we leave you the comparison of the 6 best accounts. Evo Banco has not been included because it requires payroll, and Norwegian because it does not have a branch in Spain and some other entities that we will review below.
*1: It is for an indefinite period and at 1.5% APR if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: Does not have an office network. Only a few or with limited operations.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
*5: OrangeBank gives a 1.3% APR to new customers who do not have an Orange line.
Notable differences:
*Pibank: it is the same as Renault Bank. It is a savings account, but you have the possibility of having services if you contract the payroll account.
As we already said, Renault Bank is the most attractive because it does not ask for anything and provides good profitability, followed by Pibank.
If you are a new client of Sabadell or MyInvestor, their higher profitability makes them more interesting.
On the other hand, for day-to-day operations, Orange Bank is better because it gives a decent return and offers all the services.
What is your opinion? Leave us a comment below.
Bank Norwegian offers a 2% APR account with no restrictions. The bad thing is that it does not have an office in Spain and you would have additional tasks with the Treasury (see here)
The Trade Republic broker offers a paid account at 2% APR for an indefinite period and for a maximum of €50,000 for new and existing clients. You can read our analysis here, or see information on their website, here.
In addition, we have accounts at 1% APR for:


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
379,"Wizink finally raises its savings account, now at 1% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/por-fin-wizink-sube-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-ahora-al-1-tae/,05/04/2023,"Finally, Wizink increases the profitability of its Savings Account from 0.5% APR to 1% APR, but it is still little if we compare it with other entities.
It has been giving 0.5% APR since November 2022, leaving Pibank, Orange Bank, RenaultBank, MyInvestor or Sabadell far behind.
With this increase, it is still one step behind, taking into account that these entities offer more than 1.5% APR, half a percentage point more.
In any case, this increase is appreciated and the account remains as follows:
Customers who already have an account, in the private area, continue to be charged at 0.5% APR. They should update it, because they would not understand that if they sign up for a new account they would be given a 1% APR and if they maintain their old accounts, at 0.5% APR.

A few days ago Wizink raised its shortest-term deposit to 3% APR, the most profitable of its products:
The characteristics of Wizink deposits are:
This profitability continues to be surpassed by Facto, but Wizink's is cancelable unlike the Italian entity. But Facto is definitely for a much shorter term, since it gives 2.5% APR from 3 months.
On the other hand, it surpasses Pibank by half a point, although Pibank's deposit duration is better: 12 months.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
380,"Pibank raises its savings account to 1.51% APR, its deposit remains at 2.52%",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/pibank-sube-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-hasta-el-151-tae-su-deposito-sigue-al-252/,04/04/2023,"Pibank has raised its savings account from the 1% APR that it had been offering to 1.51% APR, only surpassed by Sabadell (2% APR), MyInvestor (2% APR) and RenaultBank (1.81% APR).
Your deposit, which was raised in March, remains unchanged at 2.52% APR, also one of the most profitable on the market.
The good thing about this entity is that it does not ask for anything extra and its deposit is cancelable.
In March when the bank made the increase in his deposit, we indicated that his account was falling behind and it seems that the bank ""has listened to us.""
With this increase it is among the best accounts, only a little behind 3 entities and 2 requesting extra demands (Sabadell and MyInvestor), and only cleanly surpassed by RenaultBank.
It also leaves behind Openbank (1.25% APR), Self Bank (1% APR), Money Go Account (1% APR), ING (1.0% APR) or Evo Banco (1.5% APR with buts, see here).
The characteristics of the Remunerated Account are:
This increase also affects the payroll account:
Pibank leaves its 12-month deposit unchanged, which will remain valid until April 30, 2023:
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."
381,"Yes, BFS already offers more than 3% APR on its deposits",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/si-bfs-ya-ofrece-mas-del-3-tae-en-sus-depositos/,03/04/2023,"Last month BFS touched 3% APR, but it has already surpassed that limit this week, putting 2 of its deposits at 3% APR or higher.
These are its 18 and 25 month deposits that it offers from this week at 3% APR and 3.10% APR respectively.
The bad thing about these products is that they cannot be canceled in advance and for very long periods; a big problem because of how the types are evolving.
BFS has eliminated the 14-month deadline, which didn't make much sense. It was a deadline that was set when BdE limits (see here) on the profitability of deposits, but that was an eternity ago.
The entity has also increased the profitability of cancelable deposits by 0.2 percentage points and exceeds Renault Bank's offer, which will surely react.
If we compare it with other offers from other banks, it falls behind both in its deposits:
The difference is greater in cancelable deposits and they are the most recommended at this time. We would not take a deposit for more than 1 year and NOT cancelable given the trend in rates.
In fact, you can see this trend in the deposits of the BFS bank itself, which we show in the following table:
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until April 9, 2023, and are exclusively for new contributions.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

It is only surpassed, at a 12-month term, by a few banks such as Facto (3.25% APR) or EBN (2.55% APR) and Openbank (2.75% APR), but the latter asks for links.
This deposit can be canceled in advance, both totally and partially, like Pibank's and unlike Facto or EBN, which are not cancelable.
If you cancel early, the bank not only does not charge you any commissions, but it will continue to pay you interest, yes, at 1% APR, which is not bad at all.
This product is exclusively for new customers who open the Avantio account through digital channels.
The offer will be valid until April 30, 2023 or until the issuance volume is completed (20 million).
The characteristics of this fixed term are:
Everything looks pretty nice, but the problem is in the Avantio Account. It is free only if you have €10,000 invested in a bank product; in addition to other conditions that are easy to meet.
The entity accepts the €10,000 deposit so that you do not pay commissions on the account. So the problem would come after the expiration. You will have to cancel the account or you will have to pay €75 in semi-annual commissions (€150 per year).

Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.
The bank set the marketing deadline for this product until April 12, 2023.
Banca March relaunches the Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and now at 3% APR for new digital clients.
It represents a reduction of 0.3 percentage points compared to what the bank offered until December 31, 2023."

The previous increase was applied by the bank on January 5, 2023, putting it at 0.6% APR and now it almost triples it.
However, this offer has 3 buts:
If you arrive late and are not one of the first 50,000, the bank offers you (what it offers current clients as of today):
And current clients will receive something intermediate starting April 3 according to a statement from the bank: at 1.1% APR if they meet the requirements, and at 0.6% APR if not. Perhaps these conditions will also apply to new customers who arrive late to the promotion? We will see…
In any case, this hodgepodge of offers will anger more than one. Furthermore, no one likes linking profitability with payroll, in the style of ING or Openbank.

The conditions of your savings account are as follows:
The best thing this entity has is its account, without commissions and without conditions and with all the services that it implemented in 2020 in the style of Openbank, Orange Bank and some more:
It is the bank's strong point, allowing free debit withdrawals from more than 16,000 ATMs with no minimum amount and no withdrawal limit:
You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €120.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."

This entity is proving to be very dynamic, with changes every so often (almost monthly) and returns much higher than the competition.

Of their 2 products, we chose their savings account at 1.81% APR, since their 2-year deposit, as it does not allow early cancellations, does not seem so interesting to us despite that 3% APR.
The current features of your account are:
And from your deposit:
The big drawback of your deposit is that it does not allow early cancellations within 2 years.
This offer is valid until April 11, 2023.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

NOTE: Openbank can cancel the deposit if it sees fit, just like EBN deposits. It is undoubtedly a very bad banking practice, although it is totally legal.
Openbank also offers these deposits to customers who already have money in the bank. In this case the interest rate is 0.75% APR.
This way it would be:

On the other hand, it surpasses Pibank by half a point, although Pibank's deposit duration is better: 12 months.

This increase will come into effect from April 1, 2023 and will be the third increase since November, when the entity returned to remunerate this account at 0.3% APR.
The last time the account profitability changed was on January 1, 2023 and it will shortly increase again on April 1:
It is an interesting increase and is placed at the level of Pibank, but requiring the payroll account to give you the 1% APR will not sell very well among clients without it.
In addition, although it is a future increase, we believe that when it comes into force, its competition may have taken measures to leave ING far behind. It already happened to Orange Bank (see here)
Either way, how things have changed in just a few months. Not even 4 months ago, ING was charging commissions for the Orange Account because its clients left ""too much"" money in the account.
ING is also expected to increase the profitability of its Orange deposits, up to 1.25% APR:
Yes, the commission-free bank began charging its orange account clients €120 commission since November 2021 if you did not meet any of the following 2 conditions:
Have a payroll account and meet the conditions (domiciliary deposit or monthly transfer of €700).
DO NOT have more than 30,000 euros in the Orange Account.
A stupid decision that tarnished the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
It was only 1 year. We do not know how much money he would charge in commissions, but we do not believe it is a large amount, much less than the loss of prestige, for sure.
According to bank data, in February 2022, 14,000 clients had paid commissions. If we consider these data to be good for that entire year, the bank received €1,680,000 for this concept.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

Its evolution has been spectacular, from 0.5% APR, in January 1.25% APR and now, 2% APR.
It therefore offers more than Orange Bank or Pibank or Renault Bank; the same as MyInvestor or Sabadell.
But there are some aspects that must be taken into account:
It is just a Savings Account, similar to the ING Orange Account. You will not have any additional services.
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The account characteristics are:
The money is guaranteed by Norway's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.
At the beginning of February, in your Client Area, the entity will provide you with the annual declaration of your account for what you take into account in the income tax return.
Each one must value. Some think that the FGD of European countries is better than that of Spain, others think why, there are similar offers in entities with branches in Spain.

389,ING announces its deposit at 2% APR and 3 months on its cover. Is something cooking?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ing-anuncia-su-deposito-al-2-tae-y-a-3-meses-en-su-portada/,24/03/2023,"Incredible, but true: that ING announces a deposit and that it is news. How this bank has changed.
The entity has been forever, since April 2020 (see here), without offering deposits, any type of deposits.
Orange deposits, the normal ones, did not return until December, with interest rates also very normal.
At the beginning of March, the bank again launched the cash collection deposit, 2% APR for 3 months, in the style of a decade ago.
Both products were not visible in the public area of ​​their website, only in the customer area. It was now that the bank announced it in its public area, and it did so on the front page.

Something is brewing in banking when you can read news like ""The ECB is monitoring bank deposits daily to detect if any bank is experiencing customer departure.""
They are on guard to prevent the problems that have been experienced in the United States from spreading to Europe.
It also helps, for savers, that the interest rate is already at 3.5% and that the 12-month Euribor is already at 3.578, and above all the deposit facility is at 3%.
It is what the ECB pays for the money that banks deposit in the ECB every day.
This means that any bank that pays less than 3% for our money is profiting without any effort.
The deposit facility is a deposit without a deadline and now very well remunerated. Few banks pay 3% for our money and they can get that without any risk.
Therefore, it is normal that ING is interested in raising new money for 2%, earning 1%, without doing absolutely anything. And on top of that, there will be people who take money to the bank and then leave it there almost without remuneration.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.

The bank accepts payroll, pension or recurring income to give you the promotion:

The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

The entity already offered something similar during the month of March, with a 6 and 12 month term, but then it offered a 1.5% APR, now it has risen to 2% APR.
This deposit is much better than the welcome deposit offered to new customers (1.25% APR) and to balance increase customers, which gives up to 1.5% APR.
The current offer will only last until next Friday, March 24 and the product characteristics are:

The entity offers new clients a deposit with a profitability of 1.25% APR and a 12-month term with the same characteristics as the previous deposit.
It can be contracted online by first registering in an Open current account or by calling 91 177 33 37 or 900 36 53 66.
You will also be given an Open Debit Debit Card at no cost.
It is an account for new clients with a profitability of 1.25% APR for 1 year and, yes, there is a limit to the maximum that can be invested in this account: €100,000.
As we said, you get a little less than the welcome deposit, but you'll be able to do whatever you want with your money. As long as you leave it there, you get 1% APR, and if you find a better place for your savings, you get it without penalties:
The savings account or the welcome deposit are associated with a checking account that is also commission-free and has all the services:

392,Facto breaks the market: 2.5% APR for 3 months; 2.75% APR for 6 months and 3.25% APR for 1 year,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/facto-rompe-el-mercado-25-tae-a-3-meses-275-tae-a-6-meses-y-325-tae-a-1-ano/,23/03/2023,"Facto rise and becomes the most competitive offer on the market. High profitability (up to 3.25% APR) and short term, very short term (from 3 months).
With this offer, we can forget about accounts at 2% APR, if you can get 2.5% APR within 3 months. As much as it is not cancelable.
Just look at ING's ridiculous offer and its thousands of balance increase conditions to give you 2% APR for 3 months (see here). In fact, it gives it to you, and it doesn't matter if the money was already in the bank or not, and you can chain one deposit after another.
As for the medium term, if 2 days ago we made a comparison of 12-month deposits (see here), and even then Facto stood out for its 2.83% APR, now with 3.25% APR it is a very good offer.

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
393,"EBN makes public the increase in the profitability of its deposits, now up to 3.15% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-hace-publico-la-subida-de-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-ahora-hasta-315-tae/,22/03/2023,"On March 15, EBN raised the profitability of its deposits to 3.15% APR; however, this offer was only accessible from the bank's customer area; the previous offer continued on its public website.
In fact, not even all customers saw the new interest rates in EBN electronic banking.
Today, finally, the bank has eliminated any doubt, publishing the new offer on its public website and has sent emails to all customers about the change.
With this increase, it slightly surpasses Renault Bank which offers 3%. But of course, Renault Bank does it for a term of 2 years, and for that term, EBN gives the same profitability: 3% APR.
EBN, like Renault Bank, does not allow early cancellations of its deposits, so we have to forget about its long terms.
If we focus on the short terms, they are not bad at all: 1.8% APR for 4 months or 2.55% APR for 12 months.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
394,Renault Bank raises its account to 1.81% APR. No change to your deposit at 3.03% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/renault-bank-sube-su-cuenta-hasta-el-181-tae-sin-cambios-en-su-deposito-al-303-tae/,22/03/2023,"Renault Bank increases this time only the profitability of its savings account, from 1.61% APR to 1.81% APR. The 2-year term deposit remains at 3.03% APR.
In addition, it establishes a very short marketing period, only for 1 week, until March 29, 2023. More changes soon or commercial strategy?
This entity is proving to be very dynamic, with changes every so often and profitability much higher than the competition:
The current features of your account are:
And from your deposit:
The big drawback of your deposit is that it does not allow early cancellations within 2 years.
This offer is valid until March 29, 2023.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

We consider that the 1-year terms are on the limit of being appropriate for these times and that they already offer good profitability and a time that is not excessively long.
But before opting for any of the deposits that we will show later, we remind you that there are several high-profit accounts, even more profitable than many deposits, and you have the luxury of having your money with total liquidity.
These accounts are for example:
>> See comparison of the best accounts here.
There are 2 big ones absent from the comparison: Renault Bank and Wizink.
Renault Bank is one of the few that exceeds the 3% APR limit on its deposits, but it offers it for a 2-year term. A lot of profitability but too much time and, on top of that, it is not cancelable.
Wizink's shortest term is 18 months and 2% APR. The good thing about their products is that they are cancelable.
We have also left out 2 entities by not beating the 2% APR of the accounts, but they are interesting: BFS at 1.8% APR and Caixa Guissona at 1.5% APR.
Facto and EBN have deposits of less than 1 year that are also very interesting:
On the other hand, Targo Bank offers longer terms: 18 and 24 months, offering them at 2.4% and 2.5% APR.
Which one would you choose? Other alternatives? Leave us a comment below.


Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.
The bank set the marketing deadline for this product until April 12, 2023.

The highest rate it offers now is on its non-cancellable deposit with a 25-month term and 2.9% APR. As for cancelables, it reaches up to 2.1% APR for a 36-month term.
The strongest increase has been within a 14-month, non-cancelable period, from 2.2% APR to 2.5% APR.
As a novelty, the bank has taken out an 18-month, non-cancelable deposit at 2.7% APR, somewhere between 14 and 25 months.
If we compare it with the offer of other entities, it falls behind, although just barely, both in its deposits:
The difference is greater in cancelable deposits and they are the most recommended at this time. We would not take a deposit for more than 1 year and NOT cancelable given the trend in rates.
In fact, you can see this trend in the deposits of the BFS bank itself, which we show in the following table:
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until March 19, 2023, and are exclusively for new contributions.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.

398,"Sabadell maintains the 2% APR in its Online account, but it increases up to €250 per payroll",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/sabadell-mantiene-el-2-tae-en-su-cuenta-online-pero-sube-hasta-250e-por-nomina/,16/03/2023,"This time Banco Sabadell does come with news. After 3 extensions of the Online account promotion at 2% APR and €175 per payroll that it has been offering since November, the bank has decided to improve it.
The entity has increased, but only the part of the bonus for direct debit of the payroll up to €250, those who do not want to take the payroll to the bank will be able to contract the account online, but at 2% APR, without changes.
Furthermore, the €250 is only for the first 20,000 new customers, if you arrive late, you will only get €175 as before.
A 2% APR, despite the changes by other banks (raises or new offers at that rate), is still very good, the highest on the market. Of course, Sabadell limits the money paid: €30,000; and the term: 1 year.
Having 2% APR and liquid money, especially at this time, is very appropriate due to the expectations of more increases. So it is a good candidate to consider if you don't have a phobia of Banco Sabadell, of course.
The account characteristics are:
If you open the account and are one of the first 20,000 new customers between March 16 and April 20, 2023 and domiciliate a payroll, pension or receive recurring income, the bank will give you a cash bonus of €250.
If you are not one of the first 20,000, you will get €175. We don't like these conditions at all, they could be all or none, you are at the bank's expense. Furthermore, the bank itself says that ""it may extend the incentive of 250 euros and benefit a number of more than 20,000 clients, if it deems it appropriate."" Come on, you totally depend on the bank.
The payment of the 250 euros or the 175 euros will be made during the first 10 days of the month of July 2023 for registrations in the month of March and during the first 10 days of August for registrations in the month of April.
The bonus is net. The bank is in charge of paying you the personal income tax withholdings that will be deposited into the Treasury. In reality, the bonus paid by the bank would be higher: €308 or €216 depending on whether you receive €250 or €175.
As we indicated, the subscription is €175. Come on, the €175 bonus is net. The bank makes the income tax withholdings for you. Actually, the bank pays you €216.05.
The offer is exclusively for new clients of the entity.

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

EBN, like Renault Bank, does not allow early cancellations of its deposits, so we have to forget about its long terms.

Good profitability and a short term. It is especially good for people who think that interest rates on deposits will still rise.
It is a fixed period exclusively for bank clients who increase their balance between March 13 and 27.
The characteristics of this product are:
The offer is valid until March 27, 2023.
ING says on its website: With your money always available. You will be able to use your money whenever you want without it costing you anything.
Lie. The deposit does have an early cancellation fee, and it assumes that the interest rate paid to you is 1% APR instead of 2% APR.
Come on, you lose half of the interest generated; that's the cost. If it had no cost, it would pay you the interest generated up to that point and that's it.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

Increase in the profitability of the Targo Bank Next Account, up to 2.53% APR, surpassing Renautl Bank (2.27% APR), N26 (2.26% APR) and similar to Banco Sabadell (2.5% TAE).
That 2.53% APR is for any amount of money, as long as you leave €100 in the payment account and without an upper limit."

Logically, it is light years away from the most profitable deposits that reach up to 3% APR, even some cancelable ones like Wizink that offers 2.5% APR.
In any case, it is good news that more and more banks are trying to capture liquidity, and it could be interesting for the bank's clients.
Precisely, this offer is being sent to its clients, who can hire it if they carry money from other banks.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
The promotion is valid until May 31, 2023 or until reaching a volume of 50 million euros.
The entity also offers shorter term deposits:
On January 5, 2023, Evo Banco increased the profitability of its Savings account to 0.6% APR, from 0.2% APR.
That 0.6% is achieved if you meet certain conditions, otherwise it is 0.3% APR:
The conditions of your savings account are:
The best thing this entity has is its account, without commissions and without conditions and with all the services that it implemented in 2020 in the style of Openbank, Orange Bank and some more:
It is the bank's strong point, allowing free debit withdrawals from more than 16,000 ATMs with no minimum amount and no withdrawal limit:
You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €120.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."

The profitability of the savings account after the promotional period will depend on whether you continue to domiciliate your payroll:
The account is commission-free:
In addition, the Payroll Account offers a 0.5% bonus on direct debit bills for electricity, gas, telephone, mobile and Internet.
All of these accounts are non-permanent, so if you want to take your payroll once the first 6 bonus months have passed, you can do so.

Openbank offers new customers without having to direct a payroll a savings account at 1% APR for 1 year.
The maximum limit is €100,000, an amount that we do not recommend anyone exceed, since it is what the FGD (Deposit Guarantee Fund) covers.
The rest is the same as those who enter via payroll.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

The entity raised these products on February 22: Account from 1.41% APR to 1.61% APR and the deposit from 2.83% APR to 3.03% APR.
Therefore, it will be at this profitability for at least 1 month, and based on its history a new increase is possible in 2 weeks:

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.

It offers deposits from 3 months in term at 1.95% APR (this is the only one that is surpassed by Facto, 2.25% APR), and up to 3 years in term at 3.52% APR.
The most interesting could be the 1-year term and 3.1% APR or perhaps the 6-month term and 2.71% APR. Both have very good returns and relatively short terms.
The good thing about this bank is that it works the same as ING for Treasury purposes. You will have personal income tax withholdings and the bank will communicate your data to the Tax Agency. The only difference is that you must hire it through Raisin.
The entity, as we said, is Portuguese, so the FGD that covers your money is from Portugal, but by having a branch in Spain you save the following obligations that you do have with other foreign banks without a branch:
They offer quite good returns for what there is now in Spain:
The downside is that these products, like Facto or Renualt Bank, are not cancelable in advance or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.
Payment of interest is due.
The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."

It has also improved its offer for its existing clients with deposits of up to 1.25% APR.
In November 2022, the bank raised its welcome offer to 2% APR, but it was only for 3 months and afterward there was practically nothing for savers.
With this latest change, a 2.5% APR and cancelable for 6 months, it is now attractive for a saver to take the step and contract a product at Banco Big.
The entity also offers a deposit at 2% APR and a term of 3 months, also cancelable for new clients.
6-month welcome deposit:
3-month welcome deposit:
Customer deposits:
In this section, the bank has made a good increase in its 3 products, giving up to 1.25% APR, allowing early cancellations:
It has the same characteristics as the welcome deposit, only that the maximum investment limit is €500,000 (they have also raised it from €250,000).
Banco Big maintains its “Big Account” unchanged, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR:
Banco Big must do something with this account... because right now it is not competitive at all.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

First year:
Second year:
So, at first, you might think that it would be fine for clients who meet the requirements... but NO. This offer is exclusively for new customers.
To have all this, you must meet the following requirements:
This offer is valid until December 31, 2023.


That is the headline that you can read in the digital newspaper «elconfidencial.com«.
Oh really? Bankinter in the last decade has offered that (see here), even when ING charged commissions because people left too much money in the Orange Account (see here).
Ibercaja extends its offer of cash until December 31, 2021 in exchange for the direct debit of a payroll of at least €1,500 to the entity in the Vamos Account.
This promotion is aimed at new clients and requires a 24-month stay under penalties.
Ibercaja also offers cash to new customers who deposit a payroll of at least €1,500 with the entity in the Vamos Account.
This offer joins 6 other banks that also give money in exchange for your payroll (see here)."
409,"Pibank raises your 12-month deposit to 2.52% APR, No changes to your account at 1% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/pibank-sube-su-deposito-hasta-el-252-tae-sin-cambios-en-su-cuenta-al-1-tae/,07/03/2023,"After many months and many changes in the competition, Pibank finally raises the profitability of its 12-month deposit to 2.52% APR, although not when we thought (see here).
It is an increase of half a percentage point, from the 2% APR with the good advantage that it allows early cancellations, both total and partial.
As we commented a few days ago, this is the same profitability that it has been offering to some clients of the bank, and that it now makes it available to everyone.
The bank needed this increase, because its deposit, despite being cancelable (a good feature for these times), was equal in profitability by several savings accounts (MyInvestor and Sabadell, near Renault Bank and Orange Bank) and having your money completely liquid .
With this ""small"" increase, you get rid of all these accounts, and it gives an extra if you leave the money ""semi-blocked"" for 12 months.
In fact, it becomes the most profitable deposit that is cancelable early. and among the non-cancelable ones, there are 3 banks, but they ask for longer terms:
The only one that surpasses Pibank is Facto Account, which gives 2.6% APR from a 6-month term and at 1 year it offers 2.8% APR. But like the previous 3 entities, they are not cancelable either.
The current characteristics of your deposit are:
This offer is valid until April 30, 2023.
Unlike their deposit, which we think is now the best, their 1% APR accounts are lagging a little behind.
As we have said, there are 2 accounts that give 2% APR Banco Sabadell and MyInvestor, although with restrictions, but it is double the profitability.
Orange Bank gives 1.5% APR (1.3% APR to new customers without an Orange line) and Renault Bank at 1.6% APR for an indefinite period.
In fact, they are competitors: Openbank (1.25% APR), Self Bank (1% APR), Money Go Account (1% APR), ING (0.7% APR) or Evo Banco (0.7% APR) .
The characteristics of the Remunerated Account at 1% APR:
And the payroll account:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."
410,These are the most profitable accounts on the market for the month of March 2023,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/estas-son-las-cuentas-mas-rentables-del-mercado-del-mes-de-marzo-2023/,06/03/2023,"Accounts and deposits only increase month after month, and in a short time it leaves our comparisons outdated. Very good news for savers.
Right now on the market there are already 2 accounts at 2% APR and the 1% APR of some accounts are no longer so attractive.
They are Banco Sabadell and MyInvestor, although both entities establish restrictions for that 2% APR.
The next on the list is Renault Bank, which offers an indefinite period at 1.6% APR and then Orange Bank at 1.5% APR.
Pibank is falling behind in this race, which is even seeing competition… Openbank (1.25% APR), Self Bank (1% APR), Money Go Account (1% APR), ING (0.7% APR) or Evo Banco (0.7% APR).
In this way, the comparison is as follows:
*1: It is for an indefinite period and at 1.5% APR if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: Does not have an office network. Only a few or with limited operations.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
*5: OrangeBank gives a 1.3% APR to new customers who do not have an Orange line.
Notable differences:
*Pibank: it is the same as Renault Bank. It is a savings account, but you have the possibility of having services if you contract the payroll account.
Currently, the most interesting offer is that of Banco Sabadell: 2% APR for your first €30,000 and for 1 year.
If you have more than €30,000, we would put the excess in: Renault Bank (more profitable), Orange Bank or Pibank.
We opted for Renault Bank or Pibank for savings because they have deposits: at 2.82% APR and 2.01% APR respectively.
On the other hand, to operate day to day, Orange Bank, for its services.
MyInvestor is in no man's land. It offers more than Orange Bank and Pibank, but less than Renault Bank or Sabadell.

Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

On the other hand, the profitability of its savings account has increased from 0.3% APR (it was excessively low), to 0.7% APR, which continues to be uncompetitive compared to the most profitable accounts on the market that reach up to 2% APR.

EBN raised its savings account in October 2022 to 0.3% APR, and now it is raising it again to more than double, to 0.7% APR.
However, as we have said, it is very far from many accounts that give from 1% APR and up to 2% APR:

The account characteristics are:
Its contract is automatic if you make a deposit in the bank, or you can exclusively contract the account here.
During the month of February, EBN has offered up to 2.75% APR on its deposits, with an increase of 0.2 percentage points in almost all fixed terms.
As we always remind you, these products are deposits that do not allow early cancellations.
This fact, together with the upward evolution (which has changed in just over half a year) of interest rates, the most interesting term may be 1 year (even the bank itself highlights this) or perhaps even less. .
*Cancellable in advance by the client.

Thus, Self Bank's offer is practically the same as Pibank both in account and deposit.
The deposit has a relatively adequate term (not very long), 12 months, and a fairly decent profitability: 2% APR.
However, as we said about Pibank, both the account and the deposit are surpassed by other offers on the market. But unlike Pibank, Self Bank was dead in recent years, and Pibank was struggling to be among the most profitable.
On the other hand, we found a big drawback that will be insurmountable for many small savers in the Self Bank deposit: It requires a minimum investment of €50,000.
The detailed characteristics of the deposit are:
In order to contract this deposit it is necessary to contract the Self current account, without commissions.

Now, 3 years later, it seems that the bank wants to come back to life and attract customer money again, suddenly raising the profitability of its Savings account to 1% APR.
The bad thing is that right now, the 1% APR is no longer so attractive, considering that it is surpassed by Orange Bank (1.5% APR), Renault Bank (1.6% APR), MyInvestor (2% APR) or Sabadell (2% APR).

Self Bank takes months to make changes to its savings products. We have to go back to the month of October, when I set the profitability of its 4 term deposits that are available to all clients.
This fact contrasts with its activity in the post-summer months and it would not be surprising if it makes changes soon, but it will surely be for the worse.
Self Bank launches another term again, this time for 24 months, but less profitable than the existing ones, at 2.75% APR, which is added to the list of the 3 deposits that the bank had already been offering, which give up to 3 .3% APR.
The lower profitability of the new 2-year deposit is due to the fact that the bank also allows it to be contracted with money that the client already has in the bank, unlike the other 3 that require new money.
Self Bank launches 2 new deposits with a term of 6 and 12 months with returns of up to 3.3% APR and extends the 3-month deposit at 3.05% APR that it had been offering since July.
The 3 deposits do not ask for anything, neither payroll nor linked products, you just have to deposit new money into the bank"

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
415,10 tips for a beginner to learn about Forex,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/10-consejos-para-que-un-principiante-aprenda-sobre-forex/,28/02/2023,"The forex market is a global market where traders from all over the world can trade currencies. The market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, with a daily trading volume close to $10 trillion, making it the largest financial market in the world.
With the large forex market, there are many opportunities for beginner traders to improve their knowledge. It may seem like a daunting market for newcomers, but here are some key tips to keep in mind to ensure you start your journey the right way.

There are different types of operators in the world, so it is important to find out which one you are. Fundamental traders prefer to place trades based on current events and ongoing political and financial news. Technical traders use technical analysis tools to understand price movements and their possible forecasts. Most traders use a combination of both to gain a complete understanding of the market. Regardless of which style you prefer, using the tools available is always important to find potential trading opportunities in a constantly moving market. Analysis tools like tradingview offer a perfect view of how currencies have performed previously and also how well your plan is working. Using these types of tools is essential for all good traders.
It cannot be stressed enough that education is essential when it comes to trading. The forex market is a living, ever-changing “organism” that requires constant analysis and review. Even the most experienced traders are still learning, although it remains one of the most overlooked areas of investing. Take the time to study currency pairs and the conditions that cause their effects before you start spending your own money. An investment in time could make you more money in the long run.
A trading plan is an essential part of forex trading if you want to do what the professionals do. This plan should include your objectives, the amount you are willing to spend, your methodology, and your evaluation criteria. When you have a plan, make sure all your operations fit the established criteria. Even good decisions that don't fit your plan are considered irresponsible decisions. Eliminate emotion as much as you can throughout your entire negotiation process with a plan. Making a plan will be your most rational moment, while having placed a trade will probably be your most irrational moment.
As with everything new, practice makes perfect. When it comes to the forex market, you can open demo accounts that will allow you to see how the markets react in real time to the plan you have drawn up without risking capital. He will also have the opportunity to see what it is like to trade specific currency pairs to better understand what works and what doesn't.
Not everyone has time to sit, watch and analyze the forex market every minute of every day. If you are looking to protect any potential profits, stop and limit orders are something you should use. Using them can put you out of the market when your trade is at a price you have automatically set. Drag orders are also very useful as they work by dragging your position a specific distance as the market changes. This helps protect profits if the market reverses.
It may seem obvious, but know your limits. Your limits cover many areas, but before you trade, you need to know how much you are willing to spend on each trade and how much you are willing to spend overall. Set your leverage ratio in harmony with your personal goals. Never spend more than you can afford.

Keeping emotions under control is much easier said than done, which is why we always recommend having a plan when trading. Revenge trading is a style of trading where you are essentially betting to chase your losses, which is not the most sensible approach, to say the least! The calmest decision you will always make will be to develop your goals and strategy. Stick to your plan as long as you can, and if you ever feel like you're deviating from it, maybe it's time to create a new set of goals.
Consistency is a key element in forex trading. Losses are something you have to accept as a trader, but if you stay positive knowing that your plan has been calculated, you will have a better chance of coming out on top. Educating yourself and creating a good trading plan is all well and good, but having the discipline to follow that plan and be patient is something else entirely.

Although consistency is an essential part of forex trading, this does not mean you should shy away from exploration. It is always recommended to re-evaluate your trading plan if you find that things are not going as well as you would like. Even if things go as planned, your goals, experience, and knowledge will grow over time, which means you need to change and reflect on this growth. If your goals and financial situation change, so should your plan.
Choose the right trading platform for you. There are many options, so it doesn't matter if the first one you try isn't exactly how you imagined. Pricing, execution, and customer services have varying qualities that can alter your overall trading experience. Demo accounts are great for helping you decide which platform best suits your style, as you don't have to shell out capital but can gain real experience.

The bank is communicating this offer to its clients yesterday, February 27, 2023, and describes it as a ""flash opportunity"", because it will only last until tomorrow (inclusive) March 1. Only 3 days valid.
This offer is better than the one offered to new customers by 0.25 percentage points in profitability. The rest of the features are the same.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
NOTE: Users and clients of the bank are not informed that there is another Flash offer: 6 months and 1% APR. The rest the same.

A few days ago the bank launched a deposit for new clients with a profitability of 1.25% APR.
It can be contracted online by first registering in an Open current account or by calling 91 177 33 37 or 900 36 53 66.
You will also be given an Open Debit Debit Card at no cost.
It is an account for new clients with a profitability of 1% APR for 1 year and, yes, there is a limit to the maximum that can be invested in this account: €100,000.
As we said, you get a little less than the welcome deposit, but you'll be able to do whatever you want with your money. As long as you leave it there, you get 1% APR, and if you find a better place for your savings, you get it without penalties:
Associated Current Account: Open account
The savings account or the welcome deposit are associated with a checking account that is also commission-free and has all the services:
Openbank has a generic offer for balance increases with respect to February 28, 2022:
This offer is valid until February 28, 2023 (inclusive).


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""

417,Will Pibank raise your deposit to 2.5% APR on March 1? Because I should?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/pibank-subira-su-deposito-hasta-el-25-tae-el-1-de-marzo-por-que-deberia/,27/02/2023,"Successful Pibank clients tell us that the entity has offered them a deposit at 2.5% APR and a 12-month term.
This is the same deposit that they offer to all clients, but with 0.5 percentage points more profitability: 2.5% APR instead of 2% APR.
We believe that this entity is already taking its time to move its chips and offer at least the same personalized offer to everyone. It has been unchanged since October.
So it was one of the most profitable deposits on the market and with the good feature of being cancelable. But right now it is equaled in profitability by several savings accounts (MyInvestor and Sabadell, near Renault Bank and Orange Bank) having your money completely liquid.
Savers expect more and more rate increases. Who takes out a 12-month deposit, even if it is cancelable, if you can have it in an account and the money is completely liquid? No matter how cancelable it may be, if you do so, you lose the interest generated.
And those who do not want to be on top of the evolution of rates have other more profitable options such as Renault Bank at 3% APR, BFS at 2.8% APR or Wizink (cancellable) up to 2.5% APR.
Finally, the most active could contract short-term Facto deposits from 3 months at 2.25% APR. They are not cancelable, but the term is only 3 months.
12 month deposit:
This offer is valid until April 30, 2023.
Remunerating Account at 1% APR:
And a paid payroll account:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."

It only slightly improves the profitability of your Welcome Savings Account (1% APR), but you sacrifice liquidity. The deposit has penalties for early withdrawal.
It is good that Openbank (of the Santander group) begins to offer something for our money, but it is ""light years away"" from what other entities that already offer deposits of up to 3% APR and accounts at 2% APR, such as the cases of Renault Bank, Facto Account, MyInvestor…
But we highlight, for example, that it is already a considerably better offer than what ING is giving, which seems to be still in hibernation.

419,"Orange Bank raises your account up to 1.5% APR and up to a maximum of €200,000",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-sube-su-cuenta-hasta-el-15-tae-y-hasta-un-maximo-de-200-000e/,23/02/2023,"Orange Bank once again announces an increase in its futures account, for March 1, 2023, and up to 1.5% APR from the current 1% APR, of 0.5 percentage points.
This new profitability will be exclusively for customers with an Orange line or customers prior to December 19, 2022.
New customers without an Orange line will obtain 0.2 percentage points less, 1.3% APR, which also implies an increase of 0.5 percentage points.
The bank has also increased the maximum remuneration from €100,000 to €200,000. We do not recommend anyone put more than €100,000 in a single bank due to the FGD issue, which only covers €100,000 per person and bank.
It is an increase that we believe has taken time to make... but it will continue to lag behind Renault Bank, MyInvestor or Banco Sabadell.
The new features will be:
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.
On December 19, Orange Bank allows you to open an account without the need for an Orange mobile line. But these customers will receive 0.8% APR instead of 1% APR. Former customers maintain the 1% APR.
In less than a week these rates will go to 1.5% and 1.3% APR.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

Unfortunately, this deposit cannot be canceled in advance. Banks try to ensure liquidity in the coming months, and the most profitable products are these.
The increase has been 0.5 percentage points, from 2.3% APR, and the other non-cancellable deposit with a 14-month term remains unchanged at 2.2% APR.
Nor has it modified its deposits that allow early cancellations, in fact it has been like this for months now:
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until February 26, 2023, and are exclusively for new contributions.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

Break the 3% APR bar on your 2-year deposit and also increase the profitability of your account.
Since January 19, the bank has been offering its account at 1.41% APR and its 24-month deposit at 2.83% APR. It has lasted just over 1 month.
Starting today, the bank gives a 1.61% APR for your liquid money in a savings account, the Contigo Account, and a 3.03% APR for your money in a fixed term of 24 months, the Tú+ Deposit. Be careful, the deposit is not cancelable.
Thus, the bank continues more or less at the rate of 1 change per month:
The current features of your account are:

The big drawback of your deposit is that it does not allow early cancellations within 2 years.
This offer is valid until March 8, 2023.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.

Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.

The early cancellation fee is the same as Pibank, the bank does not pay interest on the canceled amount.
This product is exclusively for new customers who open the Avantio account through digital channels.
The offer will be valid until April 30, 2023 or until the issuance volume is completed (20 million).
The characteristics of this fixed term are:
Everything looks pretty nice, but the problem is in the Avantio Account. It is free only if you have €10,000 invested in a bank product; in addition to other conditions that are easy to meet.
The entity accepts the €10,000 deposit so that you do not pay commissions on the account. So the problem would come after the expiration. You will have to cancel the account or you will have to pay €75 in semi-annual commissions (€150 per year).

Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.
The bank set the marketing deadline for this product until April 12, 2023.
Banca March relaunches the Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and now at 3% APR for new digital clients.

423,"Banco Santander launches a deposit at 2% APR, in PORTUGAL",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/el-banco-santander-lanza-un-deposito-al-2-tae-en-portugal/,20/02/2023,"It will arrive, late, but it will arrive, you will see... Banco Santander in Portugal has launched 5 deposits giving up to a maximum of 2% APR.
This offer is to compete with Bankinter, which offers a 1.75% APR for a period of 12 months and for an amount between €5,000 and €100,000.
Santander's offer is more limited, because that 2% APR is only for an amount between €500 and €2,500. It's a small thing, but we're talking about Banco Santander.
This is your 6-month deposit, “Pequena Poupança”, linked to having contracted a credit or debit card and not exceeding 10,000 euros in all accounts at the entity.
In 2008, when the ECB's deposit facility paid 2%, bank deposits reached up to 4% APR without problems. Of course, back then there was a lot of lack of liquidity and the banks were fighting to raise money from clients.
Now, the ECB pays 2.5%, and it is expected to rise next month, the most profitable deposits do not reach the 3% APR, and deposits that offer more than what the ECB pays are rare.
In short, banks make money simply by putting savers' money in the ECB without any risk.
This situation will not last long; The banks' cushion is increasingly smaller, the amount of liquidity injected by the ECB is gradually reduced.
If you look at the deposits offered by banks in Europe, the ones here look like garbage. You just have to enter Raisin to see what some European banks offer that we can contract from Spain.
A bleeding case is Orange Bank Spain, yes, the same one that here in Spain offers an account at 1% APR or 0.8% APR if you do not have an Orange mobile, at Raisin it offers customers from Holland from 2% APR and up to 3.3% APR:
The rest of the features are:
But it's not the only case. ING, which here offers in its Orange Account a paltry 0.5% APR or 0.7% APR if you have a payroll account and deposits of up to 0.95% APR, in France you have its Libre A that gives 2% APR for a maximum amount of up to almost €23,000.
In Italy, it offers a 3% welcome APR for 3 months for up to €100,000. Of course, then it offers the same as in Spain, 0.5% APR.
In Germany it offers a savings account with a welcome 2% APR for 4 months and then at 0.6% APR. It also offers deposits of up to 2.25% APR:
And we're not talking about other banks anymore...


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
424,MyInvestor becomes the most profitable account in February 2023. Comparison,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/myinvestor-se-convierte-en-la-cuenta-mas-rentable-de-febrero-de-2023/,17/02/2023,"The ""unexpected"" rise in the profitability of the MyInvestor account at the beginning of February has caused a significant change in our ranking of the most profitable accounts.
Its 2% APR and for a maximum of €50,000 (he raised it from €30,000) and during the first year, it becomes the most profitable account.
From being in the middle position of the 5 accounts that offer the most remuneration to clients, it moves to the first position, even beating Banco Sabadell, by offering that profitability for more money (€50,000 compared to €30,000 for Sabadell).
The bad thing, as we have said, is that it is only for 1 year. MyInvestor allows you to extend that period if you are linked to investments, but for pure deposits, it is only for 12 months.
Renault Bank continues to stand out for its deposit, but as we already said in the comparison of the best deposits (see here), it offers little more than Facto, but for a much longer term.
Orange Bank, Pibank has not changed its products for a long time (September and October 2022 respectively). We think they should react.
In this way, your products are as follows:
*1: It is for an indefinite period and at 2% APR if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
*5: OrangeBank gives a 0.8% APR to new customers who do not have an Orange line.
Notable differences:
*Pibank: it is the same as Renault Bank. It is a savings account, but you have the possibility of having services if you contract the payroll account.
Currently, the most interesting offer is that of MyInvestor followed by that of Banco Sabadell: 2% APR for your first €50,000 or €30,000 and for 1 year.
If you have more, we would put the excess in: Renault Bank (more profitable), Orange Bank or Pibank.
We opted for Renault Bank or Pibank for savings because they have deposits: at 2.82% APR and 2.01% APR respectively.
On the other hand, to operate day to day, Orange Bank, for its services.

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

Specifically, since January 2019, it did not offer €50, but rather €40 in cash or Amazon check. In fact, there was a long time when Openbank stopped launching this offer, but it returned in May 2022.
This offer is exclusively for the first 2,000 new customers to meet the conditions. This condition does not seem serious to us.
The process to join the offer is simple:
The entity has also finally eliminated the clause of offering a bonus only to the first 1,000 or 2,000 new customers. This time it's for EVERYONE.

The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

426,These are the 6 banks that offer the best deposits in February 2023,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/estos-son-los-6-bancos-que-mejores-depositos-ofrecen-en-febrero-de-2023/,14/02/2023,"Month after month we are seeing how small entities are increasing the profitability of their deposits, currently giving up to 2.83% APR.
We are always talking about deposits in Spain or with a Branch in Spain, because otherwise you have, for example, Banco Progetto that gives up to 3.43% APR (see here).
However, the big banks, the same ones who were full of mouths saying that if the ECB charged for deposits (that was a lie, not all the money we put in the bank they deposit in the ECB, see here), they They had to pass it on to their clients.
Now, that the ECB pays well for the money that banks deposit in it (2.5%), in addition to being completely safe and with daily liquidity, they do not pass on that interest to clients.
Right now, any bank, without any risk, can raise money at 1% or 2%, for example, put it in the ECB and earn the difference without breaking a sweat.
In addition, everything indicates that rates will rise, and, therefore, if they raise money now with a 12-month term, they will not only gain the current margin, but the future margin, which will be greater.
Logically, banks are not satisfied with that margin, but rather invest it in other more profitable products (now and when the rates were low), such as a mortgage loan.
So, as savers, if we accept everything that is less than 2.5%, it is giving money to the bank. Thank goodness that some entities do pay what we deserve or almost.
In the following comparison we have included savings accounts, which are nothing more than demand deposits. However, they are not the most profitable (MyInvestor (2% APR) or Banco Sabadell (2% APR)). Orange Bank also offers a good savings account (1% APR).
But these entities do not offer deposits and we have left them out of the following comparison. But we will update one shortly, comparing it with the best accounts.

1.70% APR*

1.85% APR*
*: The BFS terms are 14 and 25 months, which we have compared with those of 12 and 24 months.
Observations:
Given the evolution of deposits, we believe that it is not necessary to take out deposits beyond 12 months. The profitability for this term ranges from 1.6% APR to 2.8% APR.
Facto deposits are very interesting due to their profitability. Too bad they don't allow early cancellations. But if you choose the 6-month term, it is a fairly short term and offers you a good return: 2.6% APR, almost the maximum.
We also like products from Wizink, Pibak and BFS, for allowing early cancellations.
Renault Bank is interesting for having a good account and at the same time a very profitable deposit. But 24 months and not cancelable, we would rule it out.
If we are left with a single choice: we would consider between 6 months of Facto (2.6% APR non-cancelable) vs 12 months of Wizink or Pibank (2% cancelable)
…and you, what do you think? Leave us a comment below.


There are increasing signs that deposits will decline, and therefore we must get ahead of events and prepare for what may come. We tell you what products are on the market to protect you from possible rate drops.
The beginning of October will come with some quite important news: rate increases on some accounts, expiration and/or renewal of offers. The market is on the rise and will continue to do so, we believe, at least until the end of the year.
Some of the most recent news announced are the increase in rates and other offers will expire their marketing period... they will renew it. We tell you
In the last year, the profitability of deposits has only gone up and up. Right now we can find 3% deposits without problems, and there are offers that have reached 4% APR and even more.
But what is the best deposit? The answer is not simple, it depends."
427,EBN increases the profitability of its bank deposits to 2.75% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ebn-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-bancarios-hasta-275-tae/,14/02/2023,"EBN Banco increases the profitability of all its deposits by offering a 1.5% APR for 4 months up to 2.75% APR for a 3-year term.
The increase is 0.2 percentage points in almost all fixed terms, except for 9 months, which is 0.1 percentage points.
These products have a big drawback, they are deposits that do not allow early cancellations.
This fact, together with the upward evolution (which has changed in just over half a year) of interest rates, the most interesting term may be 1 year (even the bank itself highlights this) or perhaps even less. .
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are:
This offer is valid until February 28, 2023.
>> See more details of the deposit
EBN is the first bank we have seen that does not allow customers to cancel their deposits, but the bank can do so.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
428,Openbank begins to capture liquidity by paying up to 1% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/openbank-comienza-a-captar-liquidez-pagando-hasta-el-1-tae/,13/02/2023,"Openbank has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits offering up to 1% APR.
These are 2 fixed terms of 12 and 18 months with a profitability of 0.75% APR and 1.00% APR exclusively for money from other entities.
These products are cancelable early, but at a cost: you will be paid only 0.2% APR on your money, instead of the promised interest rate.
The detailed characteristics of these deposits are:
This offer is valid until February 28, 2023 (inclusive).
It is good news that Openbank, from the Santander group, is beginning to have an interest in liquidity, but this offer is still very green if we compare it with the best on the market: Renault Bank, BFS, Facto, Pibank to name a few.
We believe that these products have been launched to compete with ING, which has recently raised its 2 deposits with the same terms:
They are practically the same.

429,When will Orange Bank decide to increase its savings account? That 1% APR is already “outrageous”,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuando-decidira-orange-bank-subir-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-ese-1-tae-ya-es-indignante/,10/02/2023,"Let's see, a 1% APR is quite good, and better than most Spanish banks, but it is ""outrageous"" from what we are going to tell you.
In recent years, Orange Bank offered more profitability than anyone else and in a savings account. But for months, that 1% APR has been surpassed and even doubled by some market offer.
These are the cases of MyInvestor or Banco Sabadell that give a 2% APR and without any requirements.
On the other hand, Orange Bank, which pretends to be a bank, does the foolish thing of giving more to its Orange customers: 1% APR compared to the 0.8% APR of those who do not have an Orange mobile line.
By the simple fact of being related to Orange, it scares away many potential clients, as well as linking them.
On the other hand, there is also Renault Bank, with a branch in Spain, which offers 1.41% APR for your money and without limits... and does not ask you to have a Renault car. Or Pibank that gives a flat 1% APR.
But the most pathetic thing is that Orange Bank Spain branch (not the Orange Bank ""headquarters""), yes, the same one that offers 1% APR for your money here, gives Dutch clients up to 3.25 through Raisin % APR. Of course, it would be in deposits. We talked about that recently here.
Today, out of curiosity, we looked at their website in France, and there they are giving 3.5% APR on a savings account and for a maximum of €50,000. 3.5% APR compared to 1% APR here.
Definitely. How much will Orange Bank decide to offer something “decent” or at least similar to the offers in Holland or France? Please leave us a comment below.
NOTE: the offer in France is for €50,000 and for a 2-month period. Afterwards it is remunerated at 0.60% APR.
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.
On December 19, Orange Bank allows you to open an account without the need for an Orange mobile line. But these customers will receive 0.8% APR instead of 1% APR. Former customers maintain the 1% APR.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
430,Caixa Guissona offers a term of 12 months at 1.5% APR cancellable,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/caixa-guissona-ofrece-un-plazo-a-12-meses-al-15-tae-cancelable/,09/02/2023,"Caixa Guissona offers a 12-month deposit at 1.5% APR with the feature that it is cancelable unlike other more profitable products.
There are few high-yield deposits that allow early cancellation, one of them is Caixa Guissona, although it is surpassed by Wizink, which gives up to 2.5% APR, of course, for longer terms (see here).
But looking with perspective, there are accounts that give up to 2% APR such as MyInvestor or Banco Sabadell or close to 1.5% APR as is the case of Renault Bank. Do deposits interest at a lower return?
The answer would be YES; Yes, there is a downward trend in the remuneration of savings products, but this is not the case right now. In any case, it is one more alternative for savers.
The characteristics of this product are:
The entity has the Multiaccount that has no commissions:


Caixa Guissona has increased the profitability of all its fixed-term deposits to 3% APR.
They are products with a not very long term: 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Allow early cancellations, in which case the bank would continue paying you for your money at 1% APR.
Caixa Guissona increases the profitability of all its fixed-term deposits, reaching a maximum of 2.75% APR.
They are products with a not very long term: 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and which also have the advantage of allowing you to cancel early; and even if you cancel, the bank would continue paying you for your money at 1% APR.
Caixa Guissona offers 4 deposits, Term Deposits Plus, with a term of up to 1 year and a return of up to 2.5% APR.
They are not the most profitable on the market, but they are very flexible and may be interesting for certain bank clients."
431,We were optimistic. Renault Bank only extends the 1.41% and 2.83% APR for 2 weeks,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/fuimos-optimistas-renault-bank-prorroga-por-2-semanas-el-141-y-283-tae/,09/02/2023,"A few days ago we were optimistic and thought that Renault Bank would increase its savings products today, but that was not the case. The bank has only extended them for 2 weeks.
The current offer was established on January 19, 2023: Account at 1.41% APR and deposit at 2.83% APR, and will last at least until February 21, 2023, just over 1 month. We'll see what he does on the 22nd.
The entity had uploaded its products in terms of less than 1 month, except for the previous one, which lasted more than 1 month and this time it seems that it will continue along the same path:

Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.

432,"Wow, Facto rises to 2.25% APR from a 90-day fixed term and 2.8% APR for 1 year",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/wow-facto-sube-hasta-225-tae-desde-un-plazo-fijo-de-90-dias-y-28-tae-a-1-ano/,08/02/2023,"Facto deserves this ""wow"", because it has increased the profitability of practically all deposits, especially short-term ones. In just 3 months it gives you 2.27% APR.
At 3 months, it is so short that it could be considered almost like a savings account, but gaining in profitability over MyInvestor (2% APR), Sabadell (2% APR) or Orange Bank (1% APR).
But at 6 months, the bank gives you 2.63% APR, reaching a maximum of 2.83% APR, for a term as reasonable as 12 months.

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
If we can criticize Facto for anything, it is that it keeps its account unpaid. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
433,ING increases the profitability of its Orange deposits… and creates with the Orange Account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-naranja/,07/02/2023,"ING has recently slightly increased the profitability of its 2 Orange deposits that it markets.
These are 2 fixed terms of 12 and 18 months and their profitability has gone from 0.6% APR to 0.75% APR and from 0.85% APR to 0.95% APR respectively.
These products are only available in the clients' private area. The bank still does not offer information about the existence of these deposits on its public website.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
They are not a big deal if we compare them with what other banks offer, because they do not even exceed the profitability of some savings accounts with liquid money (see here).
The offer is valid only until March 31, 2023.
Since February 1, ING decided to increase the profitability of its Orange account, which depends on whether or not you have the Payroll Account:
The rest of the features are:
Today we have seen that the bank requires new clients to sign up for the Orange Account to previously have a Payroll Account or NoCuenta Account.
We, who have been clients since 2000, have seen how the bank has evolved and unfortunately for the worse.
ING was the bank that we all trusted, and that owed you nothing and did not charge you for anything. An entity ""without commissions and without conditions.""
During the last few years, it lost its ""innocence"" and began to charge commissions to its clients for ""having money in the Orange account"", and now that it has eliminated those commissions, and returns to remunerate the Orange Account, it does so with conditions.
In short, the bank wants us to take it out of our minds that ING is a bank for your savings, as many clients have used it for years.
Luckily, former ING customers who only have the Orange account can continue to enjoy it as is, without additional requirements.
In any case, both the Payroll Account and the NoCuenta are good products, although the NoCuenta has certain limitations that it has had since its creation:
The ideal would be to have a Payroll account, although you have to meet one of the following requirements or it will charge you €3 in commissions per month:
These are easy requirements to meet, but sometimes you will forget to make that monthly transfer and it will cost you €3.
At ING everything is more complicated, for example than Orange Bank, which gives you everything:
And it doesn't ask for anything in return... well yes, if you want a 1% APR, you must be an Orange customer (this applies to new customers). Another one who is doing nonsense...


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

The last time the bank left it unchanged for 1 month, something that surprised us due to its history, and this latest offer will not reach that month yet, but for only 10 days.
The difference this time is that an important competitor has emerged, MyInvestor, which now offers a 2% APR on your account for 1 year, both for new clients and clients who increase their balance in the bank (see here).
In addition, there is also Banco Sabadell, which will continue for another month giving its account at 2% APR for 1 year for new clients (see here)

435,Who is that 2% APR from MyInvestor for? What about former clients?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/para-quien-es-ese-2-tae-de-myinvestor-que-pasa-con-los-antiguos-clientes/,03/02/2023,"It is clear that MyInvestor raised its paid account up to 2% APR and for a maximum of €50,000 for new clients and clients who invest in its Rodavidsor.
But what about former clients? Analyzing the PDF with the account conditions, we drew the conclusions that we indicated in yesterday's article, which was only for former clients who are still in their initial bonus period (see here); that is, clients less than 1 year old.
But as our users tell us, that was not correct according to an email that the bank had sent them. So we investigated more about it and this is what we have received from the entity:
Promotion news:
This is how the promo works:
In this way, clients of more than 1 year, for balance increases and up to a maximum of €50,000 in the account, are also given a 2% APR.
We believe that it is more or less what we indicated in yesterday's post.
For point 1, all accounts that are promoted increase up to 2% APR and up to €50,000, both new and those that have been opened less than 12 months ago.
These accounts will be remunerated from February 1, 2023: 2% APR and a maximum of €50,000 and until the initial period of 1 year ends.
In any case, consult the bank. Because nothing is clear at all.
Eye. Point 4, as we indicated, should be consulted with the bank by those affected. If anyone has information about it, please leave us a comment below.
If you have increased the balance, that increase is remunerated at 2% APR.
You can use the money whenever you want, but if you do so, and then replenish it, that new money will no longer be remunerated at 2% APR, but at the current rate in the normal account without bonuses, currently at 0.3% APR.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.

There have already been 2 extensions of this offer: January 10 and yesterday, January 31, 2023.
The account offers one of the highest remuneration on the market, at 2% APR, but limits the money remunerated: €30,000; and the term: 1 year.
If we forget that it is Banco Sabadell (it has many detractors), it is the most profitable account on the market and a great offer, exceeding most deposits and with the advantage of having liquid money.
The account characteristics are:

If you open the account between February 1 and February 28, 2023 and direct debit a payroll within 2 months of registration, in addition to the 2% APR on the account, you will obtain a credit of €175 in cash.
This time, it has to be a payroll. According to the bank: ""the payroll will be deemed to be direct debited at the time a payment for payroll is received in the Sabadell Online Account.""
The payment of the 175 euros will be made between March 20 and 31, 2023 and the payroll must be direct debited on the date of payment of the bonus.
As we indicated, the subscription is €175. Come on, the bonus of €175 is net. The bank makes the income tax withholdings for you. Actually, the bank pays you €216.05.
The offer is exclusively for new clients of the entity and today is the last day in force of the offer, unless the bank says otherwise.

Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
438,Comparison of high profitability accounts of Orange Bank vs Yoigo (MoneyGo),https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/comparativa-cuentas-de-alta-rentabilidad-de-orange-bank-vs-yoigo/,31/01/2023,"The 185,000 clients and 300 million in deposits that Orange Bank has captured in 3 years is not anything, and Yoigo wants to enter this business, and for us, the savers, we are delighted.
Unlike Orange, which took out its own banking file and opened a branch in Spain, Yoigo has taken a shortcut and uses Cetelem's financial services, and has only created a mobile application (MoneyGo).
That is, opening the Yoigo account is opening an account at Cetelem, although you will not have any relationship with Cetelem. You will do all the management through your application.
In fact, Cetelem itself markets the same account and with the same 2 modalities: 0.5% APR and 1% APR, but the bad thing is that it charges monthly commissions of €0.99 and €2.99 respectively.

With Yoigo you get rid of those commissions, but to obtain the 1% APR it requires a Yoigo telecommunications contract, which will also get you a 5% APR for the first €5,000.
As for Orange Bank, recently it also allows anyone to have an account, but discriminates against clients without an Orange mobile line, giving more profitability to clients, 1% APR. Non-customers will receive a 0.8% APR.
Both entities give you a paid savings account, a checking account and a physical or virtual debit card (mobile payment), and management via mobile App.
*Orange Bank clients prior to December 19, 2022 receive the maximum profitability, currently 1% APR.
Looking at everything, we believe that Yoigo's offer is very weak. We think it will be interesting only for current Yoigo customers.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"
439,Bank Norwegian has raised its Savings Account to 1.25% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/bank-norwegian-ha-subido-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-hasta-el-125-tae/,30/01/2023,"The Norwegian Bank, Norwegian, has increased its account profitability since the last time we published an article about it in August.
We have not followed this entity closely, but today, after an email from a user, we have seen that the entity has more than doubled since then: from 0.5% to 1.25% APR.
It therefore offers more than Orange Bank or Pibank; the same as MyInvestor, although it falls somewhat behind if we compare it with Renault Bank or Banco Sabadell.
In addition, there are other aspects that must be taken into account:
It is just a Savings Account, similar to the ING Orange Account. You will not have any additional services.
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The account characteristics are:
The money is guaranteed by Norway's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.
At the beginning of February, in your Client Area, the entity will provide you with the annual declaration of your account for what you take into account in the income tax return.
We believe that there are interesting offers in entities with branches in Spain and with similar or even better profitability, this offer is not worth it.
*1: It is for an indefinite period and at 1.5% APR if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
*5: OrangeBank gives a 0.8% APR to new customers who do not have an Orange line.
Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.7% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
The Norwegian Bank, Bank Norwegian, increases the profitability of its account by one tenth of a point more, to 3.7% APR, 0.2 percentage points more.
It is one of the most profitable on the market for liquid money.
Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.5% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
It surpasses Renault Bank (2.89% APR) by more than half a point or EBN Banco (3% APR for €10,000) and even surpasses the accounts offered by some collaborating banks on the Raisin platform, such as CKV (3.3% APR ), Klarna (3.29% APR) or Distingo (3.20% APR)."

Now comes the buts:
These are excellent conditions for a Yoigo customer. It also does not leave out non-Yoigo customers, unlike Orange Bank, which took years to move forward in this regard. But the profitability drops to 0.5% APR for all the money.
Use the same trick as Orange Bank to attract customers for Yoigo's other products (mobile, fiber...). We have reviewed their rates above, the cheapest, €10 per month.
Is it worth signing up for your account and getting a receipt? Leave us your opinion below in the comments.
In short, Yoigo offers the following (it looks a lot like Orange Bank):
Yoigo does not have a bank account, but the support is provided by Banco Cetelem.
Yoigo simply provides you with the MoneyGO application, where you can contract the products and their subsequent management.

441,Banca Progetto resumes contracting its deposits of up to 3.43% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banca-progetto-reanuda-la-contratacion-de-sus-depositos-de-hasta-343-tae/,26/01/2023,"Banca Progetto, an Italian entity, resumes contracting its 3.43% APR deposits that it had temporarily suspended.
The bank, which markets its fixed terms through the Raisin platform, stopped accepting new applications due to ""the high number of applications pending opening"", and apparently has already solved this problem.
The message that was displayed in Raisin has disappeared and according to what users of our website tell us, the bank has confirmed the acceptance of new applications.
The products of this bank are very good types due to their high interest rate. The most interesting in our opinion, those of 6 and 12 months at a profitability of 2.5% APR and 3% APR respectively:
The most characteristic of these deposits are:
It is a high-profit deposit, better than Wizink or Renault Bank due to the term/profitability issue. But Wizink stands out for allowing early cancellations. (See comparison here).
On the other hand, it has the disadvantage of being a foreign entity, Italy. In addition to the fact that the FGD is not Spanish (Italy), the investor will have to do extra things: Income Tax Return, Form 720... (See here for more information).
In addition, it markets a savings account at 0.5% APR. Quite normal, if we compare it with Orange Bank or Renault Bank (see here a comparison of the best accounts).


Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications."
442,"ING already announces the next increase in its Orange Account, it still does not advertise its deposits",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-ya-anuncia-la-proxima-subida-de-su-cuenta-naranja-sigue-sin-publicitar-sus-depositos/,25/01/2023,"ING already advertises on its website the next increase in the interest rate of its Orange Account and it will be for all clients.
However, the bank still does not offer information about its deposits on the public website, it is only available in the clients' private area.
The increase in the Orange Account interest rate was already known last week, when the bank communicated it to clients, and we all assumed that it would be an increase for everyone, as has finally been demonstrated.
In this way, the Dutch entity will pay the money deposited in the Orange Account at 0.5% APR starting on February 1. This remuneration would rise to 0.7% APR if the client also has a payroll account.

But the bank still does not offer information on its public website about its 2 deposits that it has been marketing since December.
These are 2 fixed terms of 12 and 18 months and at 0.6% APR and 0.85% APR respectively with the following characteristics:
They are not a big deal if we compare them with what other banks offer, because they do not even exceed the profitability of some savings accounts with liquid money (see here).


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

443,Santander and Openbank continue to offer €150 per payroll until February,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/santander-y-openbank-siguen-ofreciendo-150e-por-nomina-hasta-febrero/,24/01/2023,"The history of Banco Santander and its Payroll Account is similar to the commissions of the ING Orange Account. To earn a few commissions he did giant damage to his bank's image.
In the case of ING we have already mentioned it several times. A bank that lost that pristine condition of no commissions for earning just over 1 million euros for 1 year. How much will a bank spend to improve its image? (see here)
In the case of Banco Santander, which we deal with in this article, its image, in itself, is not very good; but he won a lot with Account 123. It offered a 3% APR, discounts and other advantages, when the rest offered nothing or almost nothing.
He even made some entities imitate him and tried to stop the departure of clients, such as Banco Sabadell and its Expansión Account.
Account 123 was launched to great fanfare in 2015 and it really was a good account. They attracted millions of customers.
But the good things gradually faded away, as did the clients, but it was not until 2021 when the final blow came in the month of February (New conditions and commissions for clients).
The avalanche of closing accounts must have been epic. Because those conditions did not last even half a year; announcing in July the change in the conditions of Santander One, leaving it as it was in Account Zero 123.
And shortly after (in November) he began offering €100 to attract customers again. Since then, Santander has maintained an offer of this type, currently €150, and is provided by both Banco Santader and Openbank.
The offer, which will last until February 28, 2023, asks in exchange:
We like Openbank infinitely more than Banco Santander. You know that at Openbank you will be exempt from commissions, even if you stop entering your payroll.
In fact, the entity assumes that if you domiciliate an unemployment benefit, it does not require a minimum duration of said benefit, it only asks you to make recurring income during those 12 months of permanence.
>> See details of the promotion
NOTE: apparently the offer only continues at Banco Santander. Openbank ended on January 16 and has not been extended. We are sorry for the confusion.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
444,These most profitable accounts on the market for the month of January 2023,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/estas-cuentas-mas-rentables-del-mercado-del-mes-de-enero-2023/,23/01/2023,"Last week, Renault Bank raised the profitability of its savings account to 1.41% APR, for any amount, for everyone and for an indefinite period.
It only falls behind Banco Sabadell's offer, which offers a 2% APR for new customers, for a maximum of €30,000 and for a maximum of 1 year.
In addition, it comes with a super-profitable deposit of 2.83% APR for 2 years. The bad thing is that it cannot be canceled in advance (see here).
For the first year, the best offer is still that of Banco Sabadell, which additionally offers €175 in cash and tax free if you direct a payroll. This offer from Sabadell will be valid until January 31, 2023.
Orange Bank, Pibank has not changed its products for a long time (September and October 2022 respectively). We think they should react.
MyInvestor rose from 1% APR to 1.25% APR in the month of December, and we believe that it is the fundamental reason for Renault Bank to make the recent increase.
In this way, your products are as follows:
*1: It is for an indefinite period and at 1.5% APR if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
*5: OrangeBank gives a 0.8% APR to new customers who do not have an Orange line.
Notable differences:
*Pibank: it is the same as Renault Bank. It is a savings account, but you have the possibility of having services if you contract the payroll account.
Currently, the most interesting offer is that of Banco Sabadell: 2% APR for your first €30,000 and for 1 year.
If you have more than €30,000, we would put the excess in: Renault Bank (more profitable), Orange Bank or Pibank.
We opted for Renault Bank or Pibank for savings because they have deposits: at 2.82% APR and 2.01% APR respectively.
On the other hand, to operate day to day, Orange Bank, for its services.
MyInvestor is in no man's land. It offers more than Orange Bank and Pibank, but less than Renault Bank or Sabadell.

Additionally, if you have a payroll account, then the Orange account will be paid at 0.7% APR.
We imagine that these conditions will also apply to new hires from that date.
ING, which charged commissions for the Orange Account because its clients left ""too much"" money in the account, stopped doing so and returned to paying interest since last November 1 at 0.3% APR.
In just over 1 week it will rise to 0.5% APR or 0.7% APR if you also have the Payroll account.
Yes, the commission-free bank began charging its orange account clients €120 commission since November 2021 if you did not meet any of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnished the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
It was only 1 year. We do not know how much money he would charge in commissions, but we do not believe it is a large amount, much less than the loss of prestige, for sure.
According to bank data, in February 2022, 14,000 clients had paid commissions. If we consider these data to be good for that entire year, the bank received €1,680,000 for this concept.

While here in Spain they are going around with idiotic things like offering 0.2 percentage points less to customers without an Orange line.
The only product available in Spain is a savings account at 1% APR for customers with an Orange line and 0.8% APR for customers who do not.
This is less than half or almost half depending on the type of client compared to the 3-month deposit in the Netherlands.
It seems that the money of the Spanish is worth less than the Dutch, because in addition to the difference in interest, we imagine that Orange Bank will pay for Raisin's services.
And you will say, that is a 3-month period. Yes, true, in 3 months you cannot have your money, but it is double the interest for that small inconvenience: it is only 3 months.
Let's hope that soon they will also put those deposits in Spain.
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.


Openbank continues to invent nonsense, like the previous milonga of €60 per balance increase, which we criticized at the beginning of the month of December.
This time, the entity offers a deposit with a fairly normal profitability (0.75% APR), but as if to make it excellent or attract attention, it gives you €20 in an Amazon check, if the deposit is €10,000 or more.
Renault Bank is once again late paying the interest on its account and/or deposits from the settlement for the month of June. Something similar already happened in December.
In this sense, some users have contacted us asking about the problem.
This is what needed to happen at Renault Bank to end the patience of many of its first clients.
There are many complaints about the opening process, about customer service, and now their electronic banking is down and it has been going on for several days!!!"
449,Progetto temporarily suspends the contracting of its deposits of up to 3.43% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/progetto-suspende-tempralmente-la-contratacion-de-sus-depositos-de-hasta-343-tae/,16/01/2023,"Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
This entity, which allows you to contract your deposits through the Raisin platform, has published the following message: ""Due to the high number of applications pending opening, Banca Progetto will temporarily not accept new applications.""
The truth is that the entity offers very good interest rates on its deposits. The most interesting in our opinion, those of 6 and 12 months at a profitability of 2.5% APR and 3% APR respectively:
The most characteristic of these deposits are:
It is a high-profit deposit, better than Wizink or Renault Bank due to the term/profitability issue. But Wizink stands out for allowing early cancellations. (See comparison here).
On the other hand, it has the disadvantage of being a foreign entity, Italy. In addition to the fact that the FGD is not Spanish (Italy), the investor will have to do extra things: Income Tax Return, Form 720... (See here for more information).
In addition, it markets a savings account at 0.5% APR. Quite normal, if we compare it with Orange Bank or Renault Bank (see here a comparison of the best accounts).


Banca Progetto, an Italian entity, resumes contracting its 3.43% APR deposits that it had temporarily suspended.
The bank, which markets deposits through the Raisin platform, stopped accepting new deposit requests due to ""the high number of requests pending opening"", and apparently has already solved this problem."
450,"BFS now also sells a 14-month deposit at 2.2% APR, non-cancelable",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-comercializa-ahora-tambien-un-deposito-a-14-meses-al-22-tae-no-cancelable/,13/01/2023,"BFS markets another deposit with a more acceptable term of 14 months as it is a non-concellable product. The profitability is very good, at 2.2% APR.
It is undoubtedly better than the other non-cancellable product, at 25 months and only 0.1 percentage points more remuneration, at 2.3% APR.
In November, its products were even better: It gave 2% APR for 6 months and 2.2% APR for 12 months, compared to 2.2% APR for 14 months and 2.3% APR for 25 months. months from now.
Cancelable deposits have not changed their conditions.
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until January 15, 2023, and are exclusively for new contributions.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
451,Renault Bank extends its products only for 1 more week: 1.21% and 2.32% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-prorroga-sus-productos-solo-por-1-semana-mas-121-y-232-tae/,12/01/2023,"Renault Bank leaves its products unchanged for the third time; but this time it only extends for 1 week.
At the beginning of and mid-December it extended the contracting period and now it is doing so again, but only for 7 days. Something is surely brewing in the entity.
Since July 2022, Renault Bank has been making some increase in the profitability of its deposit or savings account in the middle of the month; but it was not like that in the month of December...
Will you do it in 1 week? Will it be reaching the limit of profitability it can offer or perhaps it is enough due to the competition?
The bank's track record of change has been impressive, but it appears to have hit a screeching halt:
The truth is that the competition has not done anything in the second half of December either:
And before:

0.25% APR

0.30% APR

1.80% APR

0.50% APR

0.65% APR

And from your deposit:
This offer is valid until January 18, 2022.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

453,BitiCodes iPlex: What is it and how does it work?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/biticodes-iplex-que-es-y-como-funciona/,11/01/2023,"The cryptocurrency market never loses momentum. It is full of profit opportunities, even if you want to focus on less prominent altcoins.
You have probably heard a plethora of times that you need a proper strategy in place to trade cryptocurrencies successfully. True, but on the other hand, there are great ways to achieve success even without a strategy.
The thing is, over the last decade, the Internet has been fertile ground for the spread of cutting-edge trading technology. One of these technologies is an auto trading system like BitiCodes Iplex, which allows cryptocurrency traders to enter this lucrative market and start trading using their auto trading software.
If you are wary of the usefulness of this type of software, you can be sure that it is very effective and has several advantages. We will show you this with the example of the very popular automatic crypto trading platform Bitodes Iplex. Find out more details about this platform, as well as cryptocurrency trading activity in general. Let's start with the overview of the cryptocurrency trading process and auto trading bots.
Cryptocurrency speculation or trading refers to trading or betting on the price development of a specific cryptocurrency. This activity is viable from a crypto CFD account and consists of buying and selling crypto on the chosen exchange platform. To be relatively successful in this business, it turns out that using a trading bot is a big necessity.
Cryptocurrencies are not properly regulated or issued by traditional financial authorities. This means that cryptocurrency market operations are not centralized or controlled by the central authority. All trading processes take place on computers, while crypto assets can be traded on digital platforms and stored in specific crypto wallets. Unlike fiat currency, there is only digital proof of ownership stored on a blockchain.
When you decide to sell your crypto assets to another cryptocurrency user, you will need to transfer them to the buyer's crypto wallet. The trade will be completed once verified and added to the blockchain. This is done through the mining process, which is quite complex to explain in a few paragraphs. Through the mining process, new tokens are also created on the blockchain.
According to its name, it involves processing orders automatically, based on algorithms and machine learning software. This type of learning is based on the pure mathematical logic used by the software. The software operates on your behalf, even if your computer is turned off. However, you need to set some parameters before activating the bot. You can benefit from automated trading by registering on the site of certain brokerage companies. If you have advanced trading knowledge, you can install the software and pre-program it to apply your own trading strategy.
There are many advantages to using auto trading software, but you need to make sure you don't fall into a scammer's trap. Even experienced traders cannot always identify scammers. Fortunately, we have good news for you! We have spent a lot of time checking the business conditions and other important details of BitiCodes iPlex.
BitiCodes iPlex is touted as one of the most prominent cryptocurrency trading bots. As of 2021, it has over half a million active users worldwide.
One of the first questions that comes to a new trader's mind is whether the software is a scam. BitiCodes iPlex is definitely not a scam. Moreover, it is one of the best cryptocurrency trading robots available for cryptocurrency trading today.
The minimum initial deposit for this platform is 4250, which is quite a meager amount compared to other robots.
When it comes to trading skill level, BitiCodes iPlex is suitable for all skill levels. Fortunately, you don't have to be a crypto expert to take advantage of this auto trading robot. It helps all types of traders make better trading decisions.
How does it work? Simply put, he scrutinizes the cryptocurrency market and is able to make good decisions based on long-term and short-term market movements.
The best thing is that you can diversify your portfolio by trading with more than a thousand altcoins in addition to the most popular ones, such as Eth and Bitcoin.
Without a doubt, diversification is a great idea to use cryptocurrency trading robots to protect your investments from big losses.
One of the most important things to consider when choosing an auto-trading platform is the professionalism of its customer service. Also, make sure support speaks your language.
Biticodes Iplex customer service not only speaks English. They can be contacted by email and phone in many other languages, but make sure your native language is one of them.
In a nutshell, here are the most important advantages for choosing auto trading with BitiCodes iPlex or any other legal trading software.
Finally, as in other areas, the slightest misstep can be fatal, so you must be better equipped to avoid making mistakes. For this, you can use automatic trading software to help you.
Using auto-trading software has many advantages for traders who are new to trading or for professionals in the field. The main advantage is that the human factor is eliminated through the use of software. You will be able to work day and night for continuous hours. The software will be based solely on the settings that the user has entered. Its operation will then be based on the current market price. The application of an effective and efficient strategy will then be easier, allowing the operator to optimize.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun.

BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
In 2018 we welcomed NN Bank as a possible successor to ING by offering profitability on the accounts as much as ING charged for storing its clients' money.

Therefore, it is a foreign entity and has certain implications or precautions to take into account, if you decide to put your money in this ""bank"":
Perhaps this is what worries people the most. Have to present Form 720.
But if you are only going to have money in Trade Republic, you can easily avoid it. You must not have €50,000 in the entity on December 31 of each year and the problem has been solved.

The Guarantee Fund is at the European level that has the same protection scheme: €100,000 per person and entity, and if you invest in Trade Republic, the Guarantee Fund is the Alamán.
What is not very clear to us is whether it will be the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD) or the Investment Guarantee Fund (FOGAIN).
We believe it is FOGAIN if you read the Trade Republic legal notices (see here). Either way, the protection is the same.
As it does not have a branch in Spain, it will not withhold personal income tax. But you do have to pay taxes on the interest.
To do so, you must include it on your own in the income tax return, as we have explained before (see here).
In fact, we almost like this system better, because you don't pay anything until the following year. The bad thing is that if you are exempt from filing the declaration, by having money abroad and producing interest, you will have the obligation to present it.
Failure to do so carries sanctions (see here).
If you had a lot of money abroad, you would also have to declare it in the Bank of Spain, which requires according to Circular 4/2012, of April 25, which came into force on January 1, 2014:

Trade Republic has obtained a complete banking record from the ECB, so it will be able to start trading and bank deposits throughout the euro zone.
Its star product in Spain is its securities account, which pays 4% annually for uninvested cash and up to a maximum of €50,000.
and yes, €100,000 per person is guaranteed.
The beginning of October will come with some quite important news: rate increases on some accounts, expiration and/or renewal of offers. The market is on the rise and will continue to do so, we believe, at least until the end of the year.
Some of the most recent news announced are the increase in rates and other offers will expire their marketing period... they will renew it. We tell you
Trade Republic will also increase the profitability of its account from October 1, 2023, but double it, up to 4% annually, as announced on its website and will pay up to €50,000 at that interest rate.

How can a broker offer so much? The truth is that we don't understand this offer very well.
The business of a broker is not to raise money and lend, but to collect commissions for the purchase/sale of shares, securities...
A possible explanation could be that the entity wants to make itself known with this promotion, and attract customers and hope that they invest in its products.
So, why also give that profitability to existing customers? What do you think? Leave us a comment below.
It is defined as a German securities institution, supervised by the German Federal Bank and BaFin and has been operating in Spain since October 2021.
It says that the money is under the deposit guarantee system (SGD), specifically, that of Citibank Europe plc (see here), an Alamana entity and German Fund, which is the depositary entity of the cash.
It defines SGD as insurance for the money you have in your cash account. In the event of insolvency, your Trade Republic cash balance is protected up to €100,000 by legal deposit protection, anywhere in Europe.

In addition, with the Me card you will have 3% cashback on your purchases in 2 categories that you choose: fashion, leisure, travel, food. You can get up to €72 per year (max. €6 per month).
It is a promotion for new customers who, in addition to registering, must spend €300 during the first 3 months.

I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.

Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

Its offer was surpassed by Wizink or Pibank and also by EBN and Renault Bank, although the latter two are not cancelable, and similar to BFS.
In addition, we have to add the liquid money to the Banco Sabadell Online Account at 2% APR, yes, only for €30,000 and during the first year, and for new clients.
If we talk about non-cancelable deposits, it is undoubtedly Facto Account, although its offer has recently worsened (see here).
Have you contacted the bank? What has he offered you? Leave us a comment below.


Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.
Today we echo an email received that denounced ""what is hidden in the conditions of the current promotion of the Deutsche Bank More DB Account."""

This is the Banco Sabadell online account that offers a return of 2% APR and a maximum of €30,000 for 1 year.
If we forget that it is Banco Sabadell (it has many detractors), it is the most profitable account on the market and a great offer, exceeding most deposits and with the advantage of having liquid money.
Additionally, if you deposit a payroll into the account, the bank will give you €175 in cash.
The account characteristics are:

If you open the account between November 10 and January 10, 2023 and direct deposit a payroll within 2 months of registration, in addition to the 2% APR on the account, you will obtain a cash payment of €175.
This time, it has to be a payroll. According to the bank: ""the payroll will be deemed to be direct debited at the time a payment for payroll is received in the Sabadell Online Account.""
The payment of the 175 euros will be made between March 20 and 31, 2023 and the payroll must be direct debited on the date of payment of the bonus.
As we indicated, the subscription is €175. Come on, the bonus of €175 is net. The bank makes the income tax withholdings for you. Actually, the bank pays you €216.05.
The offer is exclusively for new clients of the entity and will last until January 10, 2022.

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
461,Why is Bitcoin a speculative asset and not a currency?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/por-que-bitcoin-es-un-activo-especulativo-y-no-una-moneda/,28/12/2022,"Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to be created and remains one of the most prominent and leading cryptocurrencies in the world. Like any other asset, Bitcoin has many advantages and at the same time some disadvantages. The value of this digital currency is highly volatile, meaning it is not a stable currency. As a result, Bitcoin is a perfect store of value and a means to facilitate transactions.
Even though experts claim that these virtual money transactions are fast, they are extremely slow. Bitcoin's underlying technology, Blockchain, ensures that transactions are more secure and transparent. However, there is a limit on the total number of transactions that users can complete daily on the blockchain. As a result, it takes days to execute even the simplest transaction. On the contrary, Bitcoin provides anonymity to its users, thus contradicting itself by being a global currency due to the slowness of transactions and volatility.
As a result of the various drawbacks of this digital money, it is more of a speculative asset than a currency. Without a stable value, this electronic currency cannot be converted into currency. As a result, this electronic asset is a commodity that one trades, like gold, in the hope that its value will increase, generating profits. Speculating an investment is good because it helps add liquidity to the market and helps determine the value of this digital asset.
On the contrary, this digital money as a speculative asset has value. This is why.
Bitcoin has a hard limit because after Satoshi Nakamoto created this digital currency in 2009, he set a limit of 21 million bitcoins. This strict limit makes Bitcoin scarce, and scarcity makes this virtual currency valuable. On the other hand, limited availability causes the price of this virtual asset to vary because the price is the only thing that can change to ensure demand.
The volatility of this digital asset is not only affected by the price, but also by the media. If there is negative news regarding this virtual currency, the price of Bitcoin will be affected and will decrease. On the contrary, if very influential people promote this digital currency and invest in it, the value of this virtual asset will skyrocket.
Bitcoin's decentralization is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Decentralization means that people will invest in an asset that is unregulated. Central banks control traditional currencies. Therefore, its value is stable. On the other hand, the value of this digital currency is not stable and most investors prefer to invest in an asset with a stable value or price. As a result, the instability makes it more of a speculative investment that you can invest in on exchanges like bitcodes-ai.com/es.
With Bitcoin, there is no guarantee of a minimum valuation, so if a group of investors decides to stop using bitcoins and sell them, the value of this digital currency would decrease significantly and affect users with significant Bitcoin holdings.
Businesses and companies are yet to accept Bitcoin payments and adopt Bitcoin. As a result, people have limited places to spend their coins. On the other hand, many business owners accept debit and credit cards, so their use is not limited. However, some companies like Microsoft and PayPal accept Bitcoin payments.
Bitcoin can potentially reshape the financial world, but it is more of a speculative asset than a currency. Therefore, the public should stop expecting it to be a currency soon.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Maybe you're wondering how blockchain technology could revolutionize supply chains? Here's how this technology could help revolutionize supply chains.
Perhaps you are wondering what qualities make Bitcoin considered money? Here's a guide to what makes this digital money so valuable."
462,MyInvestor will have its own banking license from 2023,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/myinvestor-tendra-licencia-bancaria-propia-a-partir-de-2023/,27/12/2022,"As reported by MyInvestor, starting in 2023, the entity will have its own banking license, so it will have its own bank file, entity code and FGD.
Currently, MyInvestor is a trademark of AndBank as bank code 1544, so in a few days its 150,000 clients will undergo changes in 2023.
The entity has a balance of 600 million euros in its remuneration without commissions and of ""high profitability.""
Specifically, the bank recently increased the profitability of its savings account from 1% APR to 1.25% APR for new customers and during the first year for a maximum of €30,000.
Additionally, if you invest €300 per month in products from MyInvestor's indexed portfolios (roboavisor), it will give you 1.5% APR for an indefinite period.
The base profitability of this account is 0.3% APR. This type applies to existing clients and new clients after 12 months and who do not meet the previous linkage condition.
Thus, the account has been left as follows:
>> See account details
With this increase, MyInvestor surpasses Renault Bank, OrangeBank, Pinbank and Cuenta Primera de TargoBank, being only behind Banco Sabadell.
The big difference between this account and Renault Bank, Orange Bank and Pibank is that it is for a limited time (1 year) and for a limited amount (€30,000).
These are the same limits imposed by Banco Sabadell, but giving significantly more profitability, at 2% APR.
*1: It is for an indefinite period and at 1.5% APR if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
*5: OrangeBank gives a 0.8% APR to new customers who do not have an Orange line.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
463,Facto will cut the profitability of its short-term deposits by half (< 6 months),https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/facto-recortara-a-la-mitad-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-a-corto-plazo-6-meses/,26/12/2022,"Facto has informed its clients that it will cut the profitability of their deposits starting tomorrow, December 27, 2022.
The changes will especially affect deposits between 3 and 6 months, which will be paid in half: from 2% APR to 1% APR.
The 6 to 7 month and 12 to 15 month terms will be cut slightly from 2.5% APR to 2.25% APR.
The rest of the products will remain unchanged and will continue to give a maximum of 2.5% APR, but it will be from a 15-month term.
This is the first reduction in profitability for 9 months:

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings. Similar to ING.
The entity maintains its account without remuneration. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
464,"Openbank continues with nonsense: normal deposit, excellent for €20 in Amazon check?",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/openbank-sigue-inventando-tonterias-contratas-deposito-y-te-da-cheque-amazon/,23/12/2022,"Openbank continues to invent nonsense, like the previous milonga of €60 per balance increase, which we criticized at the beginning of December (see here).
This time, the entity offers a deposit with a fairly normal profitability (0.75% APR), but as if to make it excellent or attract attention, it gives you €20 in an Amazon check, if the deposit is €10,000 or more.
To join the promotion, which is for all customers and only once per customer, you must follow the following steps:
At the outset we will say that we have never understood those limits to the number of 1,000 clients. It should tell you directly in the registration process whether they will give it to you or not and you decide whether to continue, but that is not the case here.
On the other hand, those €20 in Amazon checks increase the profitability of your deposit from 0.75% APR to 1.00% APR. In this calculation we have already taken into account the €20 of the check and that the bank is responsible for the personal income tax of that bonus, oh and the deposit has to be exactly €10,000. If it were more, profitability decreases.
A very very normal offer, with offers from Pibank, Renault Bank, Wizink... (see here), and even bank accounts with the same profitability or more (see here).
I don't know how many people will be ""fooled"" with this offer, but surely more than one will believe that it is a much better offer than it seems.
The characteristics of the deposit are:
In short, in terms of profitability, this deposit is worse than any deposit at 1% APR and 12 months term.
This offer will be valid until December 31, 2022.


As you have read, Orange Bank, a branch in Spain, offers deposits of more than 3% APR through the Raisin platform, Dutch version, and for clients in the Netherlands.
We were shocked when one of our users sent it to us via email.
Renault Bank is once again late paying the interest on its account and/or deposits from the settlement for the month of June. Something similar already happened in December.
In this sense, some users have contacted us asking about the problem.
This is what needed to happen at Renault Bank to end the patience of many of its first clients.
There are many complaints about the opening process, about customer service, and now their electronic banking is down and it has been going on for several days!!!"

How things have changed compared to 1 year ago, when they wanted to charge us for lending them our money!
The entity offers a base profitability of 1.5% APR for all deposits up to €100,000, but if you put more, up to €200,000 it gives you 1.7% APR, and if you put even more, the bank gives you a 1, 81% APR.
This is what the new Transparent deposit from Banco Caminos offers for a term of 12 months and which allows total or partial early cancellations.
As we always indicate, it is not advisable to put more than €100,000 per person and entity, which is what is covered by the FGD.
The detailed characteristics of this deposit are:
This offer will be valid until January 31, 2023


CBNK, the new entity resulting from the merger of Banco Caminos and Bancofar, has launched a deposit with a 6-month term and a 3.29% APR.
Banco Caminos, also BancoFar, tries to attract new money by offering a 12-month deposit at a 3.29% APR.
It is a deposit with a not very long term and has the advantage that it is cancelable, although the interest rate is not one of the highest on the market (up to 4% APR), but 3.29% APR is Pretty decent, especially for the bank's existing customers.

We are glad that every day there are more and more deposits on the market, but this offer is clearly inferior to Wizink, Facto, Renault Bank...
The profitability is good, 1.9% APR is among the most profitable, and its term, 18 months and non-cancelable, is not so popular anymore, but the worst thing is its associated account, the Avantia Account.
This account has commissions of €75 per semester unless you meet the following linking conditions:
The characteristics of the deposit are:
The offer will be valid until January 27, 2023 or until the established issuance volume is reached (150 million).


Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little.
Banca March's Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and 3% APR for new digital clients will be available for 1 more month.
The bank set the marketing deadline for this product until April 12, 2023.
Banca March relaunches the Avantio Flexible deposit with a 12-month term and now at 3% APR for new digital clients.
It represents a reduction of 0.3 percentage points compared to what the bank offered until December 31, 2023."

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"
468,Orange Bank now allows you to sign up for your account without being from Orange,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-ya-te-permite-contratar-la-cuenta-si-ser-de-orange/,19/12/2022,"Orange Bank is now available from today, Monday, December 19, 2022, for any customer of any telecommunications operator, according to a statement from the bank.
But those who are not from Orange will not receive 1% APR, but only 0.8% APR, for a maximum of €100,000, the same limit for everyone.
This change will NOT affect current customers who are no longer Orange, and will maintain the 1% APR, and in this sense the bank is communicating to its customers.
We have been waiting for this news for quite some time, in fact the entity said that by the end of 2021 (see here), but it has finally arrived.
However, we believe that it is truly stupid to link your profitability to whether or not you belong to their mobile company. If I were the bank, I would try to disassociate myself as much as possible from Orange, which many have had problems with and do not even want to see in painting.
In this way, the characteristics of the account are as follows:

Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1 and for a maximum of €100,000, but finally the increase was up to 1% APR, the current rate.

Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

This entity has been providing this product for more than a decade (we published it for the first time in 2012) without changes in the promotion: neither with the stratospheric rates of 2012, nor with the pyrrhic rates of these years ago, nor now that banks are once again encouraged to offer decent rates.

As a requirement, the bank requires you to sign up for a Payroll Account (payroll direct debit from €800).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below (enter the email correctly in case the sponsor/godson has to contact you).

Cancelable deposits have not changed their conditions.

BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.

472,We make ECO of: Wizink fails to comply with the additional 3% because you return,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/hacemos-eco-de-wizink-incumple-el-3-adicional-porque-tu-vuelves/,14/12/2022,"A user of our website wrote to us who wanted us to echo his problem with Wizink and the additional 3% promotion because you return from Wizink.

I have been complaining to Wizink since September 20 because they did not comply with the conditions of the card of an additional 3% if purchases outside of CEPSA exceeded €300.
I made the claim through the Wizink page and they immediately responded with an automatic message that they would respond within 5 to 7 days.
After 10 days I made another claim to say that they had not responded. After 15 days of not answering I called them and they told me that they were business days. I called again within 12 days and they told me they had a 30 day deadline. A month later I called them again and all they do is apologize and talk to the department that resolves it and they give good words but 0 actions. I called at 60 days and 80 days and it's still the same.
You can publicize the case, because I think that is the only thing that hurts them, speaking badly about them.
Thank you so much
Our user refers to the following promotion, perhaps not identical to the one he mentions:

You can ask our user in question about the topic in more detail.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
473,Opebank wishes you a happy account and a prosperous €40. Let's go with the usual offer,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/opebank-te-desea-feliz-cuenta-y-prosperos-40e-vamos-la-oferta-de-siempre/,14/12/2022,"Openbank relaunches its offer to attract customers from its online account, giving a €40 welcome bonus, now for the Christmas holidays.
The entity went for a long time without launching this offer, but this is the fourth time the bank has launched it since May for different reasons.
This offer is exclusively for the first 2,000 new customers to meet the conditions. This condition does not seem serious to us.
The process to join the offer is simple:
Before January 23, 2022, the entity will deposit €40 into your account, if you are one of the first 2,000, of course.
>> See details of the promotion
The issuance and renewal of additional cards for other cardholders will cost €18 per card per year.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""
474,"MyInvestor increases the profitability of your account to 1.25% APR, 1.5% linked",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/myinvestor-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-su-cuenta-hasta-el-125-tae-15-vinculado/,13/12/2022,"MyInvestor has increased the profitability of its savings account from 1% APR to 1.25% APR for new clients and during the first year for a maximum of €30,000.
Additionally, if you invest €300 per month in products from MyInvestor's indexed portfolios (roboavisor), it will give you 1.5% APR for an indefinite period.
The base profitability of this account remains at 0.3% APR. This type applies to existing clients and new clients after 12 months and who do not meet the previous linkage condition.
Thus, the account has been left as follows:
>> See account details
With this increase, MyInvestor surpasses Renault Bank, OrangeBank, Pinbank and Cuenta Primera de TargoBank, being only behind Banco Sabadell.
The big difference between this account and Renault Bank, Orange Bank and Pibank is that it is for a limited time (1 year) and for a limited amount (€30,000).
These are the same limits imposed by Banco Sabadell, but giving significantly more profitability, at 2% APR.
*1: It is for an indefinite period and at 1.5% APR if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
475,"TargoBank Next Account also targets 1% APR, with 1 “but”",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuenta-proxima-de-targobank-tambien-se-apunta-al-1-tae-con-1-pero/,12/12/2022,"TargoBank has increased the profitability of its Next Account from 0.7% APR to 1% APR to match Orange Bank, Pibank or MyInvestor.
It is good news, although this product has a small defect, and that is that it requires certain conditions to be exempt from commissions unlike Orange Bank or Pibank (see comparison of the best accounts).
This new profitability applies to all new customers and customers retroactive to November 1, 2022.
What this bank really offers are 3 connected products: a checking account, a savings account and a debit card, very similar to what Orange Bank offers:
And the but, is that the bank asks that you meet one of the following 3 requirements to NOT pay commissions:
If you do not meet one of these 3 requirements, you will have to pay €8 per month in account maintenance fees.
The bank gives the bank a few months of grace, the account being exempt from commissions: the month of contracting and the following 3, even if you do not meet any of the conditions.
What we don't like is that the bank is moving money from your checking account to your savings account without your permission:
The Next Account allows up to a maximum of 2 holders.


Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
TargoBank continues to offer its Amigo Plan, in which the client (sponsor) and the new client (sponsor) can each get €30 for signing up for the Next Account, a PRIME Subscription Account and/or a fixed-term deposit.
The Targo Bank Next Account has a very interesting interest rate, 2.53% APR, an interest rate set in the month of June.
Increase in the profitability of the Targo Bank Next Account, up to 2.53% APR, surpassing Renautl Bank (2.27% APR), N26 (2.26% APR) and similar to Banco Sabadell (2.5% TAE).
That 2.53% APR is for any amount of money, as long as you leave €100 in the payment account and without an upper limit."
476,Comparison of the best fixed-term deposits for December 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/comparativa-de-los-mejores-depositos-a-plazo-fijo-de-diciembre-2022/,09/12/2022,"The deposit market has turned upside down. If at the beginning of the year it was difficult to find any deposit close to 1% APR, now they offer more than double that.
The most active banks in recent months are: Renault Bank, Pibank and EBN Banco. But Pibank, Wizink, Cuenta Facto or Deutsche Bank have also considerably improved their offers, and even ING has once again offered its Orange deposit (up to 0.85% APR), but its profitability is still low in comparison (see here).
The most significant changes that have occurred since the last comparison are the following:
So we proceed to compare the best entities, also including remunerated accounts, after all they are demand deposits.
However, we have left out Orange Bank (1% APR), MyInvestor (1% APR) and Banco Sabadell (2% APR). The 3 entities offer good profitability in their accounts, but they do not sell deposits, and if you want to see a comparison of their accounts with the rest, you can see it here.

0.25% APR

1.70% APR

0.30% APR

0.50% APR

0.65% APR

0.70% APR
*2%: 2% penalty for the period between the cancellation date and the deposit expiration date. The penalty will never exceed the gross interest.
Observations:
Given the evolution of deposits, we believe that it is not necessary to take out deposits beyond 12 months. The profitability for this term ranges from 1.8% APR to 2.5% APR. Those from Wizink, Pibak and BFS are more interesting by allowing early cancellation.
If you opt for Facto, I would take the 6-month term and 2.5% APR. Very good profitability and a relatively short term.
These deposits are interesting, except if we compare them with the Sabadell account at 2% APR.
If you don't like Sabadell, then these deposits are worth it, since it offers twice as much as the accounts (1% APR). The profitability of future deposits should increase significantly to compensate for this difference.
A good option is also the Renault Bank Account at 1.21% APR.
The most versatile entity is Pibank. With your account at 1% APR and your 12-month deposit at 2.01% APR and cancelable. You could bet part of your money on the deposit and part on their paid account.
…and you, what do you think? Leave us a comment below.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
477,ING's Orange deposits are back: 12 and 18 month terms and up to 0.85% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/vuelven-los-depositos-naranja-de-ing-a-12-y-18-meses-de-plazo-y-hasta-el-085-tae/,05/12/2022,"ING, after a long, long time, is once again offering deposits to its clients. But with uncompetitive profitability and a too long term.
The only good thing is that it allows early cancellations in its 2 fixed terms of 12 and 18 months and at 0.6% APR and 0.85% APR respectively. If you withdraw money before maturity, you will not be paid anything.
These products, Orange deposits, appear only in the entity's customer area and are valid until December 31, 2022.
The question is: Who would contract these deposits with Pibank and Orange Bank giving 1% APR or 1.21% APR in RenaultBank in a liquid account, where you can use your money whenever you want and without questions or costs?
The characteristics of these products are:
ING does not charge fees for the associated Orange Account, but it is only a savings account.
It also does not charge a commission for the NoCuenta Account (see here).
Your payroll account, if you do not meet its requirements, will charge you 3 euros in commissions per month (see here).


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
478,"If BCE charges for deposits, so do banks; but if you pay, the banks mutis total",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/si-bce-cobra-por-los-depositos-bancos-tambien-pero-si-paga-los-bancos-mutis-total/,05/12/2022,"We only have to go back 1 or 2 years to read news from important people in Spanish banking, who came on stage and vehemently said that ""if the Central Bank of Europe (ECB) charged them interest for keeping their money in it, they should to pass that cost on to customers.
This idea caught on with some entities such as ING, which began to charge interest to its clients, which had a certain amount of money saved in the Orange account, and which has been in force until recently.
Well, now the situation is the other way around. Since September 14, 2022, the ECB increased the deposit facility's remuneration to 0.75%. That is, banks can put our money that we lend them in the ECB with total liquidity, and it gives a 0.75% annual return.
Which banks give that profitability now? Does ING do it? Santander?… There are a handful of banks that offer that or something else, and absolutely no one says anything about clients having to be remunerated because the ECB pays them. Everyone very quiet.
They have the deal of the century, they pay nothing for our money, and they put it without any risk in the ECB and collect. But then it was also a business, but now it is even more so.
In fact, the banks do not take all our money and put it in the ECB, only a small part: 1% of customer deposits being mandatory.
So, it cost them that little bit of money and they were continually crying. We made an estimate and it assumed a 0.025% APR cost (see here).
But what banks really do is take our money and invest and/or lend it, to earn much more.
Now with the Euribor through the roof and rising, it captures our money at 0 cost, and lends it at 3% or more in a mortgage, and if it is a consumer loan, the interest rate skyrockets. Quite a business.
Why don't the banks come out saying that their clients must be paid better?
Now any bank that doesn't pay you at least 0.75% APR for your money is a ""jeta.""
Luckily, there are banks that offer interest on your money, and if you have the money in a less profitable account, it is as if they charge you commissions in terms of opportunity cost (see here):
*1: It is for an indefinite period if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for prematurely withdrawing her friend's plan, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

The entity is sending an email to its clients that tells them that: «get up to €60 for increasing your balance in Openbank«.
To do this, the bank says that you have to follow these steps:
The bank will reward you with:
Excellent? Well no. You have to read the fine print that indicates that you must keep at least 50% of your savings until 6 months from the end of the promotion (July 16, 2023).
Come on, it is as if it were a 6-month deposit, which in the best of cases:
In short, 2 deposits with maximum profitability equivalent to:
They are not bad at all, but be careful, this will be less if you do not strictly comply with what we have indicated. It is a milonga, because more than one will be deceived and for various reasons:
By the way, the offer is also for new clients of the bank.

As for, your 24-month deposit remains at 2.32% APR, it is very good, except for the burden that it is not cancelable.

482,Challenges facing Bitcoin mining today,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/retos-que-enfrenta-la-mineria-de-bitcoin-hoy/,01/12/2022,"Bitcoin has performed remarkably for over a decade. In addition to being the most successful cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is the most valuable in the world today. This digital currency is enjoying increasing global acceptance, with several merchants endorsing it. Furthermore, Bitcoin remains one of the most attractive payment options for international businesses.
Bitcoin technology has also paved the way for many lower class people to earn a living and enjoy various financial services. This cryptocurrency changes the rules of the game because it knows no barriers. You can use Bitcoin regardless of your region or country. Cryptocurrency is immune to government regulations because it does not depend on intermediary entities.
Mining has been essential in ensuring the stability of various digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Although it is an expensive and demanding process, its benefits are excellent.
Mining is one of the lucrative ways to invest in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. However, this does not mean that you have not experienced any inconvenience before. Even today, Bitcoin mining companies face several problems. These are some of the main challenges facing Bitcoin mining that you should be aware of.
Incompetence is a major problem in almost every economic sector and the cryptocurrency sector is no exception. Being a new technology, it is difficult to get enough people with relevant technical knowledge of mining and machine operation. This has led some Bitcoin mining companies to train people before absorbing them. But training is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, the lack of sufficient qualified personnel slows down the extraction or mining process and significantly minimizes income.
In manufacturing businesses, we talk about production costs. In Bitcoin mining, there is the operational cost. Cryptocurrency mining requires high-end supercomputers. When this idea emerged, one could use their personal computers at home to mine bitcoins, however, things changed after several people joined the activity, pushing the competition to the max.
Miners need powerful computers instead of the laptops previously used to successfully mine cryptocurrency. Without such robust equipment, mining agencies could hardly make a profit. The problem is that acquiring powerful supercomputers requires a lot of capital. As a result, many organizations are unable to properly fund the Bitcoin mining process to keep the network running.
Higher startup costs force several mining companies to close, leading to bitcoin shortages. Additionally, higher upfront costs take time to recover in order to register real growth. If mining machines were relatively cheaper, many people would join the activity and mine many more coins.
Price volatility is one of the main drawbacks of the cryptocurrency sector. Even those who trade on certified cryptocurrency exchanges like bitcoin billionaire. They find it difficult to deal with price variations. According to available data, Bitcoin prices were highest in November 2021, but despite the favorable price of over $60k, prices have fallen sharply since January 2022.
Price volatility is a major risk for Bitcoin mining investors because it can cause unprecedented losses. For example, miners earn more income when Bitcoin prices rise. However, the profit drops significantly if Bitcoin prices fall. Cryptocurrency price swings will remain a key investment challenge until the industry stabilizes.
Operations are vital in any business because they create products and services. But there is a big problem if the costs are so high. Spending too much to finance mining operations reduces the return on investment. Various sources reveal that between 30 and 40 percent of Bitcoin mining revenue goes towards electricity bills. This means that the resulting profit is not high enough to purchase new and better mining equipment or maintain existing ones.
Although some governments have already approved the use of Bitcoin within their territories, many have not yet done the same. Some nations consider cryptocurrencies to be risky and have made them illegal. This means that aspiring Bitcoin mining investors cannot operate in such countries. Additionally, countries like China banned Bitcoin mining because it consumes a lot of electrical energy. Mining will be easier and more profitable once the world has fully adopted cryptocurrency.
Like other sectors, Bitcoin mining experiences several challenges. These include having inadequate qualified personnel, high startup costs, price fluctuations, high operating costs, and political factors. But despite the drawbacks, Bitcoin mining remains one of the most lucrative investments you can start today.

Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Maybe you're wondering how blockchain technology could revolutionize supply chains? Here's how this technology could help revolutionize supply chains.

484,"EBN slightly lowers its deposits after Black Friday, up to 2.4% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-baja-ligeramente-sus-depositos-tras-el-black-friday-hasta-24-tae/,29/11/2022,"EBN Banco slightly lowers the profitability of its longer-term deposits and those labeled with “black Friday.” We imagine that it must justify it being an extra offer.
The reduction is insignificant, only 0.15 percentage points in the terms of 18, 24 and 36 months, which will return to what was paid before ""black Friday.""
It is the same interest rate that was given in the month of October, and as we have indicated a few times, they are not at all interesting due to their excessively long term in a scenario of continuous rate increases.
Especially when dealing with deposits, early cancellations are not allowed.
The term that is perhaps most interesting is 1 year (even less), and it is more indicative to see how the bank has evolved.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
EBN's YES deposits that can be canceled early have not been modified since July and offer, at most, 0.7% APR.
There are other entities that give much more, even in demand accounts (Sabadell, Orange Bank, Pibank, Myinvestor..., see here)
The rest of the features are the same:
These deposits currently have no set marketing deadline.
EBN is the first bank we have seen that does not allow customers to cancel their deposits, but the bank can do so.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
485,"Deutsche Bank raises the profitability of its deposits, up to 1.85% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/deutsche-bank-realiza-un-subidon-en-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-hasta-185-tae/,28/11/2022,"Deutsche Bank was one of the first to launch deposits with a certain profitability (up to 0.6% APR) in the month of May 2022.
As an indicative example, Reanult Bank then offered its 24-month deposit at 0.7% APR.
However, it was something specific, because since then it had remained unchanged despite the movements of the other banks (Renault Bank has been repeatedly raising its fixed term, up to 2.32% APR).
Today we have realized that this entity has made an increase in those same products, multiplying its profitability by up to 10.
These are 3 fixed terms, called Solidez DB Deposit, which have undergone the following changes:
Seeing its features:
It is surpassed in profitability by Wizink or Pibank and also by EBN and Renault Bank, although the latter two are not cancelable, and similar to BFS.
In addition, we have to add the liquid money to the Banco Sabadell Online Account at 2% APR, yes, only for €30,000 and during the first year, and for new clients.
If we talk about non-cancelable deposits, it is undoubtedly Facto Account, the entity that takes the cake, with a profitability of 2% APR from 3 months or 2.5% APR for 6 months.
Additionally, these deposits have the drawback that they are only for new clients and for money from other banks.
It is great news that Deutsche Bank is also entering the battle of deposits, and being an entity ""with offices"" as many of our users say, offering profitability like this is worthy of mention, but it has its drawbacks.
We will soon write an article comparing all of these deposits in more detail.


Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.
Today we echo an email received that denounced ""what is hidden in the conditions of the current promotion of the Deutsche Bank More DB Account."""
486,"Wow, Facto offers 2% APR for 3 months and 2.5% for 6 months and from 1 year",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wow-facto-ofrece-al-2-tae-desde-3-meses-y-25-a-6-meses-y-desde-1-ano/,25/11/2022,"These are already bigger words. Giving you 2% APR for a term as short as 3 months or 2.5% APR for 6 months and all terms longer than 1 year are interest rates worth mentioning.
In relation to the 3-month offer, it is double what the bank had been giving.
While the terms between 6 and 12 months have decreased slightly, but we believe that no one is interested, except those of 3 or 6 months (2% APR and 2.5% APR respectively).
Not even those of 1 year or more, which are the same as 6 months, because we believe that the market will improve.
This new offer comes into effect now and will last until December 23, 2022.

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
The entity maintains its account without remuneration. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
487,"…What happened to NN Bank, the “ING successor”? Did you get lost along the way?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/que-paso-con-nn-bank-el-sucesor-de-ing-se-perdio-en-el-camino/,24/11/2022,"In 2018 we wrote that «NN Bank is fully committed to attracting customers with savings accounts, offering a profitability of 0.3% APR, without commissions and without limits. Its profitability is only surpassed by Banco Pichincha (0.5% APR) and some foreign entity such as FerratumBank (0.6% APR) and few others, and equals what Wizink and COINC offer.»
The Dutch insurer Nationale Nederlanden, which was renamed NN Bank, and ING went hand in hand, but since 2018 it began to raise money in exchange for profitability when no one offered anything, and even less so ING, which went so far as to charge for having the money of the clients.
It seemed like it was going well, but in 2022, things have changed, banks are already giving 1% APR or more on accounts, and ING has returned to remunerating its clients' money at 0.3% APR.
In this scenario, NN Bank remains anchored in that 0.2% APR that was set in August 2021, more than 1 year ago.
Furthermore, if you take into account that it is a foreign entity without a branch in Spain, unlike ING, it will come to nothing, due to its low profitability and its drawbacks:
Of course, the bank does offer telephone customer service in perfect Spanish (with the feeling that we have spoken with ING) and a website also in our language.
The current features of your account are:
Will there be increases in this entity or will it close?


BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
Novum Bank, an entity from Malta, and WITHOUT a branch in Spain, offers a deposit at a high interest, 2.5% APR, and a one-year term.
It would be similar to Wizink, Facto or EBN, but much shorter term. The bad thing is that the money would be abroad and what it entails."
488,"Openbank also gives a 1% APR, but only for 1 year and to new customers",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/openbank-tambien-da-un-1-tae-pero-solo-durante-1-ano-y-a-los-nuevos-clientes/,23/11/2022,"We have been talking for months about accounts without commissions and without conditions with a profitability of 1% APR. Openbank could be included in this list of banks.
We are talking about the Openbank Welcome Savings account that now offers 1% APR from the first euro up to €100,000 for 12 months to new customers who register.
But we have to say that, comparatively, it falls far behind: 2 right now already offer higher rates (Sabadell and Renault Bank) and another 2 offer for all clients and without time limitations (Orange Bank and Pibank).
It is only slightly better than MyInvestor by offering that 1% APR for an amount up to €100,000 (€30,000 in MyInvestor).
In any case, we are not going to complain either, the more offers of this style will push interest rates up.
The account does not carry any commission, it does not ask you for anything in return. Only if you are a new customer of the bank and you register with the code “WELCOME”.
The summary of the account is:
The savings account is associated with a checking account that is also commission-free and has all the services:
As we say, these conditions are nothing extraordinary if we compare them with the other 5 best accounts on the market:
*1: It is for an indefinite period if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

But that 5-5 tie would not last long.
A few days before the beginning of November, Banco Sabadell decided to modify its online account, offering a 2% base APR without ties and if you also direct debited a payroll, it would give you €175 in cash. In addition, it sets the marketing deadline until the end of the year.
Already, in mid-November, Renault Bank made a slight increase in its savings account, from 1% APR to 1.2% APR. Although it sets its validity until November 30, we will hardly see it lowered.
Thus, the month of December will begin with at least 3 accounts at 1% APR, one at 1.2% APR and another at 2% APR.

*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
Notable differences:

Currently, the most interesting offer is that of Banco Sabadell for your first €30,000 and for 1 year. 2% APR on cash is a bargain.
If you have more than €30,000, we would put the excess in: Renault Bank (more profitable), Orange Bank or Pibank.
We opted for Renault Bank or Pibank for savings because they have deposits: at 2.32% APR and 2.01% APR respectively.

491,EBN raises its deposits to 2.55% APR. Is Black Friday coming to banking?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-sube-hasta-255-tae-sus-depositos-lleva-el-black-friday-a-la-banca/,21/11/2022,"Ebn Banco says that Black Friday is coming to the Bank, but we believe that it is an offer that is here to stay and will even soon be surpassed by the bank itself, unlike the Black Friday offers, which are something super temporary and the prices return to what they were. past this date.
In any case, it will mean a slight increase in the profitability of deposits in this entity, from 2.4% APR to 2.55% APR.
This is nothing more than another change, for the better, of the entity in recent months, but the pace of growth is slowing down:
The changes only affect deposits with a term of more than 1 year, the rest remain unchanged. We especially point out that in recent months 1-year deposits have risen sharply, this time it has not been like that, it remains at the same rate:
And as we always say, the bad thing about these deposits is that they are NOT cancelable in advance and in a few days (starting November 2) Wizink will give up to 2.5% APR, and that they are cancelable:
EBN's YES deposits that can be canceled early have not been modified since July and offer, at most, 0.7% APR.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.

EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

The entity has increased the remuneration of its account from 1% APR to 1.21% APR, standing out compared to the other accounts at 1% APR (see here), but continues behind Banco Sabadell (see here).
As for, your 24-month deposit remains at 2.32% APR, with the burden that it is not cancelable.
Would you bind yourself for 2 years at 2.32% APR, having an account at 2% APR with liquid money? We don't see it seeing how the profitability of deposits increases month after month.
In summary, the new features of the account are as follows:
Your deposit remains unchanged:

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.

493,Banco Big offers a deposit at 2% APR; the bad: only for 3 months,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-big-ofrece-un-deposito-al-2-tae-lo-malo-solo-durante-3-meses/,17/11/2022,"Banco Big doubles the profitability of its customer acquisition deposit, offering right now at 2% APR.
It represents a great improvement, in addition to eliminating the need to combine it with other products, simply if you are a new customer, you benefit from this deposit with an extra rate.
The bad thing, as we say, is that the bonus period is very short: only for 3 months, however, the paid limit is decent: €50,000.
With this product a new client can get €250 gross interest during the 3 months if they deposit €50,000
It has a certain similarity to the offer from Banco Sabadell. Both give 2% APR and during an initial period:
The features are:
The profitability of the other 3 deposits available to existing clients has also increased slightly:
It has the same characteristics as the welcome deposit, except that the maximum investment limit is €250,000.
Banco Big maintains its “Big Account” unchanged, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."

We do not doubt that the entity will continue to offer these products at least at that profitability, the question is whether the bank will raise the interest rate on these products.
As background we have the month of October, which the bank maintained unchanged at the beginning of the month and raised it in the middle.
We opt for this option as the most likely, that is, that on the 18th there will be an increase, especially due to the latest movement by Banco Sabadell that offers its savings account at 2% APR (see here).
If you can have the liquid money at 2% APR, why put it for 2 years and without the possibility of cancellation at 2.32% APR.
Do you have your opinion? We leave you a little help with the bank's change history in recent months:
Thus, your deposit is as follows:
The big ""but"" of this offer, and it is the majority opinion of all savers, is that the bank does not allow you to draw your money in advance in case of need.
This offer is valid until November 17, 2022.

Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).

In this sense, the bank has communicated to its clients. For new customers, it seems that these new conditions apply now, as we have been able to see on their website.
This entity is not precisely characterized by the profitability of its account, but because it is an account without conditions and without commissions.
In any case, this increase is appreciated, but it is minimal. It actually offers a 0.3% base APR, and if you meet the following conditions it gives you a 0.6% APR:
The actual increase is 0.1% percentage points and offers an extra bonus of 0.3% APR if you meet the links.

You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €120.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.


Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."

The but is that its 2 most profitable deposits: 6 and 12 months and 2% and 2.2% APR, are deposits without the possibility of early cancellation.
As for the rest of the deposits, which are cancelable early, the interest rate has been slightly increased: between 0.2 and 0.25 percentage points.
*In RED, NON-cancelable deposits.
The characteristics of these products are:
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until November 6, 2022, and are exclusively for new contributions.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

If at the beginning of the year it was difficult to find any deposit close to 1% APR, now they offer more than double that.
Even savings accounts that improve the profitability of practically all of those deposits.
The most active banks in recent months are: Renault Bank, Pibank and EBN Banco. But Pibank, Wizink or Cuenta Facto have also considerably improved their offers.
In this comparison we have also included interest-bearing accounts; after all, they are demand deposits.
However, we have left out Orange Bank, MyInvestor and Banco Sabadell. All 3 entities offer accounts at 1% APR; but they do not sell deposits, and if you want to see a comparison of their accounts with the rest, you can see it here.

0.25% APR

1.70% APR

0.30% APR

0.50% APR

0.65% APR

0.70% APR
Observations:
Given the evolution of deposits, we believe that it is not necessary to take out deposits beyond 12 months. The profitability over this term is very similar (from 1.8% APR to 2.01% APR) among all banks. Those from Wizink, Pibak and BFS are more interesting by allowing early cancellation.
Yes, we believe that these deposits against the accounts are worth it (1% APR): You get double the profitability. The profitability of future deposits should rise significantly to compensate for this difference.
The most versatile entity is Pibank. With your account at 1% APR and your 12-month deposit at 2.01% APR and cancelable. You could bet part of your money on the deposit and part on their paid account.

But it will be surpassed by Wizink in a few days (2.5% APR, see here).
The changes in this entity have been a true reflection of what is happening with interest rates:
The most interesting thing is the movement of 1-year deposits, which has taken a leap in quality:
The bad thing about these deposits is that they are NOT cancelable in advance and in a few days (starting November 2) Wizink will give up to 2.5% APR, and that they are cancelable:
EBN's YES deposits that can be canceled early have not been modified since July and offer, at most, 0.7% APR.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are the same:
These deposits currently have no set marketing deadline.
EBN is the first bank we have seen that does not allow customers to cancel their deposits, but the bank can do so.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

It is something more than strange, but lately it seems to be ""fashionable"", to schedule future increases. What will the banks gain from this?
Orange Bank did something similar and it came out ""frog."" It had to be rectified before the program increase came into effect (see here).
ING will return to remunerate the money in the Orange Account, but only at 0.3% APR from November 1, 2022.
Likewise, it will eliminate the meaningless commissions that it had been applying to the Orange Account.
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission on the Orange Account unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
ING has been against the current in its latest movements. In addition to charging commissions in the Orange account, it now also charges commissions in the Payroll Account (see here).
Wizink will increase the profitability of its deposits next week on November 2 to 2.5% APR.
It will match the current Facto Account offer that gives up to 2.5% APR for terms from 2 years (see here).
Thus, in 2 weeks the deposit offer of this entity will be as follows:
The characteristics of Wizink deposits are:
The Savings account will also increase, which will go to 0.5% APR:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

There are 3 accounts, the Single Account, Freedom and Evolution. The most interesting and least linked is the Single Account, which we will talk about below.
The Single Account is a customer acquisition account that offers a bonus in the form of profitability during the first 2 months.

This product is contractable until December 31, 2022.
Banco Mediolanum launched a customer acquisition deposit in mid-September, giving a 2% APR for 6 months.
But we already said then that it had a big BUT. The entity requires that at the time of maturity, at least one of the deposit holders must be part of the MEDIOLANUM A TU MEDIDA program. And that makes it a deposit combined or linked to a lot of things (see below).
The entity allows a maximum investment of up to €50,000, so a new client could get €500 gross interest in that time in half a year, which is not bad at all.
This offer is exclusively for new customers starting August 1, 2022 and will last until December 31, 2022.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
The bank has limited the maximum deposits to 30 million euros.
That you have to have some investment fund, loan, credit, payroll...
In this way, we will classify this deposit within the combined or linked deposits, and it loses all its value.

Banco Mediolanum offers a deposit at 4% APR for 6 months for new clients, the same as Banco Big, but it has a big ""but"".
This entity requires that you have managed assets of at least €3,000 as of the deposit expiration date or have a payroll or pension deposited directly (minimum €700) at the end of the month prior to the deposit expiration.
Banco Mediolanum launches a customer acquisition deposit, offering a 2% APR for 6 months to the entity's new customers.
It becomes the most profitable deposit of Spanish banks, surpassing EBN Banco (1.75% APR)
According to the CEO of Banco Santander, José Antonio Alvarez, the entity is planning to charge for non-operational accounts (without movements), but always from companies and large corporations.
On the other hand, the interest rate on deposits continues to fall, and there are fewer and fewer options for savers. We indicate the best deposits."

Of those who have not been paid, some have contacted the bank, and after giving many detours, not at all clear, they tell them that they will pay on November 15, ignoring the contract and customer complaints.
Those who are having the most problems are those who have accepted the promotion of the payroll account, which increased profitability by an extra 1% APR.
In such cases they tell us that the interest settlement is quarterly, when the conditions of their product clearly indicate that the payment is monthly and on the 15th of each month.

If you direct debit a payroll or 3 receipts, you will receive another 1% extra APR, on the profitability of your account for €30,000 and for a period of 1 year.
This is not a public offer that appears on their website, but rather the bank sends you an email after opening the Online Account.
The payroll required is €700 and the 3 domestic bills can be for electricity, gas or mobile or landline telephones (they can be from your partner).
If you open the account through the recommendation of a friend, you will receive an extra 1% APR. The friend who recommends you also increases his profitability by 1% APR in his online account.
To be a sponsor, you must have previously received a communication from the bank with a personalized code, which you can share personally and only with one person, according to the conditions of the campaign. Be careful with mass mailings.

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
509,Does EBN increase the amount paid in your Account to 0.3% APR retroactively?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-comunica-la-subida-de-la-cuantia-remunerada-su-cuenta-al-03-tae-de-forma-retroactiva/,24/10/2022,"EBN Banco communicates, today, October 24, via email to its clients that it has increased the remunerated amount from €30,000 to €50,000 as of October 1, 2022.
When reading the statement, we said, good for EBN that it seems to be retracting a change for the better and not like others (Orange Bank, ING or Wizink) with a view to the future.
But digging a little… the bank already communicated this fact in the month of September (see here). It doesn't report anything new.
Same amount paid, and same profitability: 0.3% APR. At the moment it is scarce, the same as what ING will offer (see here), since other entities offer up to 1% APR (see comparison), more than triple what EBN Banco or ING offers.

These are the characteristics of the account:
Its contract is automatic if you make a deposit in the bank, or you can exclusively contract the account here.
EBN Banco has risen for 3 consecutive months (July, August and September) but has maintained profitability in the month of October:
The most interesting thing is the movement of 1-year deposits, which has taken a leap in quality:
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are the same:
These deposits were set to be marketed until October 12, but the bank has extended it indefinitely.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
Banca March increases the profitability of its 12-month Flexible Avantio deposit to 3.1% APR for new digital clients.
It is a slight increase, of 0.1 percentage points, from the 3% APR. But given the downward trend, and after the bank's latest decline, an increase is appreciated, even if it is so little."
510,Openbank must react: savings account at 0.2% APR and deposit at 0.5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/openbank-debe-de-reaccionar-cuenta-de-ahorro-al-02-tae-y-deposito-al-05-tae/,20/10/2022,"Openbank raised the profitability of its savings account at the beginning of October, but only to 0.2% APR and on top of that it asks for links. If not linked, it will give you only 0.05% APR.
It is very little if you compare it with the 5 most profitable accounts on the market, at 1% APR (see here) or with some others like Wizink at 0.5% APR (see here) and it will even be less than ING: 0. 3% APR (see here).
The account characteristics are:
It is a fairly poor deposit, only 0.5% APR which if we compare it with Orange Bank, Renault Bank or Pibank... it is light years away.
It can only boast in front of ING, which we do not know if it will once again offer the famous Orange deposits that have been off the market for years.
In addition, it is only for new income and a 12-month term:
Logically, the product has no commissions and the offer will be valid until October 31, 2021


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

511,"Renault Bank increases, as we thought, its deposit to 2.32% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-sube-como-pensabamos-su-deposito-hasta-231-tae/,19/10/2022,"Renault Bank has not disappointed and has increased the profitability of its 24-month deposit to 2.32% APR.
It clearly beats Wizink (2% APR as of November 2), but is surpassed by Cuenta Facto (2.50% APR) at that time.
But the Italian entity offers a 2.25% APR (a little less than Renault Bank), from 6 months, a much more appropriate term in these times than 2 years. Especially if we talk about non-cancellable deposits.
On the other hand, it maintains the savings account at 1% APR like the other 4 accounts (Orange Bank, Pibank, MyInvestor and Sabadell) at that profitability (see comparison here).
Thus, your deposit is as follows:
This offer is valid until November 3, 2022.
And your account:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."

What will you offer tomorrow?
The last update, on October 4, was somewhat disappointing. Renault Bank, after learning that Orange Bank matched its offer, did not make any changes.
The entity's current offer is from September 20, and since then quite a few things have happened:
Not even 1 month has passed, and what was an impressive offer is now one more, and as some users say in the comments: whoever offers more and sooner will win the day.
Offer an account at 1% APR so that you have liquid money without conditions:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
It is a good account, the most profitable on the market along with 4 other accounts: Orange Bank, Pibank, Sabadell and MyInvestor (see comparison).
And a deposit with a 24-month term and 1.81% APR:
Since the term is 2 years, at the outset, we will say that it is too long for how the deposit market is evolving.
In addition, there are entities that offer much more for that term (Wizink) or that offer a similar term for much less (Pibank).
With all this, we believe that tomorrow we will have a better offer from the bank or should if it wants to attract more liquidity. Maybe you've caught on enough?

513,Wizink will increase the profitability of its deposits to 2.5% APR in November,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-hasta-el-25-tae/,17/10/2022,"Increase in Wizink: increase your 18-month deposits up to 2% APR (current 1.1% APR), 25-month deposits up to 2.3% APR (now 1.2% APR) and the 36-month term, up to 2.5% APR (from 1.3% APR).
The savings account also increases, from 0.05% APR to 0.5% APR.
This increase will be applied from November 2, according to a statement from the entity. Why are banks now announcing increases in futures? What will it cost you to put it in from now on? Who will hire anything in this bank until then?
It will match the current Facto Account offer that gives up to 2.5% APR for terms from 2 years (see here).
Thus, in 2 weeks the deposit offer of this entity will be as follows:
The characteristics of Wizink deposits are:
Wizink will also increase the profitability of your account in November from 0.05% APR to 0.5% APR:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
514,"Facto Account, the most profitable deposits from 6 months of term, at 2.25% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/cuenta-facto-los-depositos-mas-rentables-desde-los-6-meses-de-plazo-225-tae/,14/10/2022,"Since the last increase, Facto Account deposits are the most profitable on the market after 6 months.
Up to 6 months it is equaled by the 5 savings accounts (see here) that remunerate your money liquidly at the same interest rate as the Italian entity.
Their offer ranges from 1% APR to a 6-month term; and up to 2.5% APR for a term of 2 years or more.
The downside of this entity is that it does not allow early cancellations, but giving you a 2.25% APR for 6 months, we do not think it will be a problem.
It is, without a doubt, at this time, the entity that offers the most for your money in all terms, it is a shame that its savings account is still at 0% APR.

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
The entity maintains its account without remuneration. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
515,"EBN's offer up to 1.75% APR was not so ""flash"". The extension for an indefinite period",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/la-oferta-de-ebn-hasta-175-tae-no-era-tan-flash-lo-prorroga-por-tiempo-indefinido/,13/10/2022,"EBN Banco offered its deposits as if it were a Flash offer, which did not last long; but in the end it was not like that, and it was extended for an indefinite period.
In fact, we thought that the profitability of their products would even increase, because that is what it has been like in the last 3 months:
The most interesting thing is the movement of 1-year deposits, which has taken a leap in quality:
The bad thing about these deposits is that they are NOT cancelable in advance; So the most interesting ones are short-term, such as 4 months at 0.9% APR.
YES deposits that can be canceled early have not been modified since July and offer a maximum of 0.7% APR.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are the same:
These deposits currently have no set marketing deadline.
EBN is the first bank we have seen that does not allow customers to cancel their deposits, but the bank can do so.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
516,Openbank is also on the hunt for liquidity; but it only offers 0.5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/openbank-tambien-se-pone-a-la-caza-de-liquidez-pero-solo-ofrece-05-tae/,12/10/2022,"Openbank launches a liquidity collection deposit after years without offering anything.
But this offer is quite poor, only 0.5% APR compared to Orange Bank, Renault Bank or Pibank. But it is good news just for the fact of going out to the market to raise money.
The entity has informed its clients of the availability of this deposit with 12-month terms for new income.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
Logically, the product has no commissions and the offer will be valid until October 31, 2021.
This product is not one of the most profitable on the market. Currently, we have accounts with a profitability of 1% APR, and for all amounts of money in Orange Bank, Renault Bank or Pibank (see here).
As for deposits, there are offers of 2% APR as in Pibank or 1.8% APR in Renault Bank. Very much superior to what Openbank offers.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

Three of the accounts are really good, because they do not require anything and give you that 1% APR for an indefinite time and the other two require requirements and/or are for a limited time.
The first 3 are: Renault Bank, Orange Bank and Pibank, which are logically the most interesting.
Of these 3, only Orange Bank limits the money paid to €100,000, but taking into account that this is what is covered by the FGD, it doesn't really matter. We do not recommend putting more than that in the same bank.
The second are: MyInvestor and Banco Sabadell, which were once great offers, but now not so much.
*1: It is for an indefinite period if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*2: They have Banco Pichincha offices (there are not many), and operations are limited.
*3: If you want a card in Pibank you must open the payroll account.
*4: One owner at the opening and another going to an office
The 5 accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences:
*Pibank: it is the same as Renault Bank. It is a savings account, but you have the possibility of having services if you contract the payroll account.
Renault Bank, Orange Bank and Pibank are the clear winners and with little difference, if we take into account that we do not recommend putting more than €100,000 per person and entity so that the FGD covers our money.
We slightly opt for Renault Bank and Pibank for savings because they have deposits: at 1.81% APR and 2.01% APR respectively.
On the other hand, to operate day to day, Orange Bank, for its services.
Sabadell and MyInvestor were good at the time, now they have fallen behind.

Remember that to make deposits at the current interest rate you do not need to cancel your deposit, you just have to press “Add deposit” and make a new one at the current rate.

Renault Bank and Orange Bank are the clear winners and with little difference, if we take into account that we do not recommend putting more than €100,000 per person and entity so that the FGD covers our money.
We slightly opted for Renault Bank for savings because it has a deposit at 1.81% APR. On the other hand, to operate day to day, Orange Bank, for its services.
Sabadell and MyInvestor have limited the amount paid, but the worst thing is that this profitability of 1% APR is for a limited time.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
Currently, we believe that the best are: Orange Bank and Renault Bank.
As we have already mentioned, Renault Bank for savings and Orange Bank for day-to-day operations.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
521,Banco Santander also offers €150 if you direct your payroll to its Online Account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/banco-satander-tambien-ofrece-150e-si-domicilias-tu-nomina-en-su-cuenta-online/,06/10/2022,"Banco Santander has improved its payroll capture offer, now offering the same as Openbank, €150 instead of the €100 it had been giving.
The demands are similar to Openbank and the same as the previous campaign:
Your offer will be valid until December 2, 2022, and may be extended according to its bases.
This entity has been trying to capture payrolls since November 2021 after losing thousands and thousands of them. All because of his ""greed"" by imposing commissions on his Santander One account that replaced Account 123.
All this has happened in 2021:

Something has changed, the accounts of the usual banks (those that charge for everything): BBVA, Santander and Sabadell, are now WITHOUT CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT COMMISSIONS.
On the other hand, ING requires conditions or you will have broken services, and on paper it is the worst:
The best account on PAPER right now is undoubtedly Sabadell. It gives you a return of 1% APR for 12 months for a maximum of €30,000.
El Pero is ING and his Account NoCuenta:
Strange, very strange, that in a comparison, we have to put the disadvantages of ING, instead of its advantages. Something change.
Many of you will say. If you have a payroll account, it has many advantages. Yes it's correct. But it has been ING that has launched an account like those of 3 other banks and that is why we compare it.
In fact, we continue to insist that it is stupid for ING to make this move, when the other banks are moving in the opposite direction.
Furthermore, imposing a commission on your Payroll Account of €3 because your clients do not make a monthly transfer to the account of €700 is even more stupid. Yes, they can withdraw the money as soon as they arrive.
You will earn some commissions for those clients who are absent some month. They will get angry and leave. Something is going wrong at ING, and we are deeply saddened.
NOTE: Not only are BBVA, Sabadell or Santander offering NO CONDITIONS AND NO COMMISSIONS. There are many more banks: Orange Bank, Imagin Bank, Evo Banco, MyInvestor…


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
522,Openbank also reacts. Give €150 per payroll and raise the bill to a paltry 0.2% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/openbank-tambien-reacciona-regala-150e-por-nomina-y-sube-la-cuenta-al-misero-02-tae/,05/10/2022,"Openbank launches an offer to attract payroll, giving €150 bonus to both new clients and current clients who domicile one with the entity.
It serves both payroll, pension and unemployment benefit, as long as it is greater than €1,000 net per month or €600 if your age is between 18 and 31 years.
In addition, it requires a 12-month stay. The offer will be valid until November 4, 2022.
The process to get this bonus is as follows:
The entity allows those who domiciliate a benefit, if they stop receiving it, to make recurring payments or domiciliate the payroll or pension in Openbank with a stay of at least 12 months from the first domiciliation due to unemployment.
>> See details of the promotion
The entity has increased the profitability of its savings account to 0.2% APR (4 times more) for its clients with payroll, and to 0.05% (instead of 0.01%) for those without.
It is a large increase in percentage, but compared to what other entities offer: Orange Bank (1%), Renault Bank (1%), …, it is a pittance. Even ING will offer more (0.3% APR).


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""

523,"Wizink is also getting in line to capture liquidity, Deposits of up to 1.3% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-tambien-se-pone-a-la-cola-para-captar-liquidez-hasta-13-tae/,05/10/2022,"We had been saying for some time now that what is wrong with Wizink, because their deposit offer was ridiculous, since they have already reacted, going from 0.35% APR to 1.3% APR on their deposits.
It has been a good increase, but taking into account that several banks offer your liquid money at 1% APR (see here), who is going to put it at 1.1% for 18 months or 1.2% for 24 months or at 1.3% APR for 36 months, given the upward trend of these products?
If you already want deposits... Why hire Facto, which offers 2.5% APR from 24 months (see here) or similar offers?
This increase is good, but we believe that it will not change things much.
Its current deposit offer is:
The characteristics of Wizink deposits are:
Wizink maintains its savings account at 0.05% APR for all the entity's clients, an interest rate that is laughable at the current time.
The characteristics of this account are:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

But between them they have nothing to do with the conditions of access to that remuneration.
Thus, for example, Renault Bank's 1% APR for any client, for an indefinite period and with no investment limit, is far from Sabadell's 1% APR, which has limited duration and amounts, only for new clients and requiring other links.
Without a doubt the most interesting are those of Renault Bank and Orange Bank as you can see in the following comparison.

Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

The offer was launched at the beginning of August and has been extended several times, but the bank has decided to end the campaign now, in the month of October.
Now, when new customers register, they will only get the account paid at 1% APR, which is not bad at all, although there are better offers: Renault Bank or Orange Bank.
A client could obtain a maximum of €300 in interest, which without withholdings would be around €240.
The settlement for this promotion will be carried out on a monthly basis starting on November 1, 2022 and payment on the 15th of the following month.

In recent months, the entity offered an extra 1% APR on the profitability of the account if you direct deposited a payroll of €700 or 3 receipts.
We do not know if it is still in force. This offer is not public. It is not listed on their website, but the bank sends you an email after opening the Online Account. If you are interested, call the bank and ask about this offer.

526,He had no other choice. Orange Bank to go up to 1% APR instead of 0.7% APR tomorrow,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/no-le-quedo-otra-orange-bank-subira-al-1-tae-a-partir-de-1-de-octubre/,30/09/2022,"Before the increase announced by Orange Bank of up to 0.7% APR is applied tomorrow, October 1, today it has announced that it will be at 1% APR.
We already said that this deferred increase does not work, because before it came into effect, Renualt Bank (1%) had already stepped on that increase.
How much money will be going from Orange Bank to Renault Bank? Keep in mind that it is liquid money in both entities, and once you move the money, why go back if it doesn't matter to you?
Perhaps Orange Bank thinks that with these deferred increases it will retain liquidity from its clients? What do you think? Leave us a comment below.
Thus, for now, starting tomorrow, October 1, both Orange Bank and Renault Bank will remunerate your liquid money at 1% APR.
You could match these offers only for 3 days, because Renault Bank plans an update on October 4.
Taking into account how active Renault Bank is and that it knows where it can steal liabilities and clients, which are those of Orange Bank, it is most likely that it will raise its offer, even before the deadline.
In the month of July, Renault Bank raised its account to 0.55% APR, to beat Orange Bank and apparently they fell somewhat short, and on September 1 it raised it again to 0.7% APR, and After Orange Bank's announcement at 0.7% APR, it rose to 1% APR.
In addition, we must bear in mind that Renault Bank offers a deposit at 1.81% APR, it is the clear winner for savings.
Of course, Orange Bank offers a series of services that Renault Bank does not have: cards, direct debits, Bizum, instant transfers...
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
On September 5, it announced that it would rise to 0.7% APR on October 1, for a maximum of €100,000 and today it announces that it will be at 1% APR.

527,Does Renault Bank NOT comply with customers' right of withdrawal?,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-no-cumple-el-derecho-de-desistimiento-de-los-clientes/,29/09/2022,"A user of our website writes to us who contracted a deposit at Renualt Bank at 1.4% APR and who is encountering problems requesting withdrawal from the contract within the period accepted by the General Law for the Defense of Consumers and Users (LGDCU) .
He tells us that on September 6 he contracted a deposit at 1.4% APR in the entity for a period of 2 years.
On September 13, within the legal deadline, he wants to exercise his right to withdraw from the contract using the form available in the private area.
The entity contacts the client and asks them to make the request via signed letter, accompanied by a copy of the DNI, and does so immediately (that same day), using a digital certificate.
Since then he has contacted the bank on numerous occasions and through different means and has not received another response that is ""in process"" and no date has been set.
On September 23 he receives an email from the bank that says:
Logically, our user feels frustrated and helpless in this situation and asks us to report this case of non-compliance with the LGDCU:
The businessman will refund all payments received from the consumer and user, including, where applicable, delivery costs, without undue delay and, in any case, before 14 calendar days have elapsed from the date on which he has been informed of the decision. of withdrawal from the contract of the consumer and user in accordance with article 106. In case of unjustified delay on the part of the businessman regarding the return of the sums paid, the consumer and user may claim to be paid double the amount owed, without prejudice to his right to be compensated for damages suffered in excess of said amount.”
>> See the LGDCU here
As he tells us:
My confidence in the solvency of Renault Bank has plummeted. This unjustified abuse leads me to the suspicion that they may have serious liquidity problems, since many other users may have also wanted to exercise their right of withdrawal around the same dates (in which other entities made much more advantageous deposit offers). I suspect that they are simply incapable of returning the capital deposited to those of us who have requested to withdraw from the contract, which seems extremely serious to me. I know that in other banks it is normal for the money to be returned practically immediately after having requested the withdrawal of a deposit. I am telling you all this in case you think it is appropriate to publish a news item about it, which could give rise to other similar cases through the comments.
Our user has correctly exercised his right of withdrawal in due form and on time.
If the value date of the right of withdrawal request was September 13, the bank should have returned the money on September 27 at the latest, and, therefore, it is breaking the law and must be compensated as as established by law.
In case of non-compliance, the client must contact the entity's customer ombudsman. If you do not receive a response within 2 months, you must file a complaint with the Bank of Spain, which will issue a resolution, although it will not be binding.
If the bank ignores the resolution of the Bank of Spain, the only route will be judicial.

Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.

What changes is the prize, the conditions for accessing the bonus will remain practically the same:
We believe that the €100 Amazon check is more flexible, because it allows you to use it to buy anything from the online store.
On the other hand, the round trip flight is only if you were planning to take a trip that requires a flight within the next year. Normally, the prize in value of the flight for 2 people is greater than the €100 of the check.
If you want the flight, starting next Monday, October 3rd.
The promotion gives a free round-trip flight (Spain / Europe / Morocco) for 2 people in exchange for the requirements that we already indicated.
The bonus does not include airport taxes that will have to be paid by the customer (€24.95 each way).
Once compliance with the conditions has been verified, it will send you an email with the voucher number to redeem on the Grupo Incentivo Regalo landing page.
You will have 2 months to register on the platform and up to 12 months to choose between 5 booking and flight windows.
The campaign begins on October 3 and there is no scheduled end date.

Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.

They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
530,Cryptocurrencies as a payment method in stores?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/criptomonedas-como-metodo-de-pago-en-comercios/,28/09/2022,"Today, many people, I would say the majority, read news about Bitcoins specifically or cryptocurrencies in general and think that it is something fictitious, something intangible, the stuff of geeks who want to make easy money (or lose).
In a way they are somewhat right, because cryptocurrencies are not something physical with which you can go to a store and pay, although it is not completely crazy, they are already talking about Bitcoin ATMs. But in the end it is just like using a credit card, your smartphone or your smart watch to pay in stores, with crypto you can also pay for some of your purchases. Logically, it is still a very limited option.
There are several alternatives to make payments with cryptocurrencies:
There are applications that allow you to create an electronic wallet with which to make payments such as:
Each one accepts different cryptocurrencies and is accepted by different companies as a form of payment.
Some companies use cryptocurrencies as a form of marketing to take advantage of the media hype. But its use is very limited, but the list of companies is long. As an example, we name the best known:
Using cryptocurrencies to make payments has some advantages over the traditional form of electronic payment:
Due to blockchain technology, making payments with cryptocurrencies gives you anonymity, it is one of the characteristics that stands out among the payment methods in online casinos. Traditional methods leave a trace of where you have spent your money and no one should care or care about that.
Additionally, it is completely secure, because it is difficult to reuse, falsify or cancel a completed transaction.
An operation with cryptocurrencies is immediate, just like cards or Bizum, unlike bank transfers that require some time (except immediate ones).
Cryptocurrency transfers are usually cheaper than bank transfers or traditional payment gateways.
It is especially useful in international payments and with currency exchanges (you do not need to exchange currencies with cryptocurrencies).
Not at all. Using cryptocurrencies is associated with a set of major drawbacks. We will list some:
We believe that it is acceptable to think that cryptocurrencies are a form of investment, with many risks; a way to escape state regulations and interventionism; but as a form of payment or a standard circulation currency, we don't see it yet.
Maybe you're wondering how blockchain technology could revolutionize supply chains? Here's how this technology could help revolutionize supply chains.

EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
532,Everything you need to know about the stock market before investing,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/todo-lo-que-debes-saber-de-la-bolsa-antes-de-invertir/,27/09/2022,"Do you feel captivated by the stock market, but don't know how to invest in it? Worry no more, because you are in the right place. In this article we explain in a simple way everything you need to know to get started in this exciting world. Keep reading!
The first impression we usually have of the stock market is that it is an exclusive place for millionaires, but the reality is very different! It is true that it originated in the palace of a noble family in Bruges, Belgium, in the 16th century. However, the business concept that inspires it has changed a lot since then.
Currently, the stock market is a large market that brings together both bidders and buyers of capital. Its main form of negotiation is the purchase/sale of shares through intermediaries. Although debts are also negotiated. In any case, it is a very good opportunity to do business, even with a low investment.
Stock markets are vitally important to the global economy. Because they facilitate the carrying out of transactions and channeling savings, they also make possible a better allocation of economic resources.
Fundamentally, they are a great alternative for financing companies, which translates into a boost to the economy. In addition, they allow shareholders to obtain liquidity through the sale of shares. On the other hand, individuals can benefit from making their savings profitable. And it is a regulated market that offers information, which becomes a guarantee of security.
Although the stock market is a safe market, it is still possible to lose a lot of money. This is why, before investing, it is essential to know basic concepts of the capital market, such as investment, volatility and diversification, among other aspects.
On the other hand, preparing yourself psychologically is of great importance, since by investing in the stock market you can both win and lose. Another fundamental point is to focus on security and opt for low-risk investments such as those in well-known companies with lower volatility. Finally, we recommend diversifying your portfolio and creating an emergency fund.
If you have reached this point it is because you are seriously thinking about investing in the capital market. First of all, you should know that the stock market can be physical or virtual and that investing in it is like playing an online casino. Without a doubt, it is very exciting, but it also involves a lot of responsibility. If you are of legal age and have money to back your investment, you can start by following these steps:
Investing in the stock market can be a good option to get more out of your savings. It's even so easy that you can do it from home. In addition, it offers you advantages that other investments cannot offer you, such as security, flexibility and liquidity. And you, are you ready to start?

533,Targo Bank gives you a welcome €40 net for opening a Next account at 0.7% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/targo-bank-te-regala-40e-netos-de-bienvenida-por-abrir-cuenta-proxima-al-07-tae/,27/09/2022,"Targo Bank has launched a campaign to attract new customers for its Next Account (0.7% APR) offering a welcome bonus of €40.
To obtain this bonus you just have to follow the following steps:
Don't try to look for this promo on their website, because it doesn't appear, at least it has been impossible for us to find it.
Even if you follow the indicated steps, the bank tells you to give it to you, but if you enter the wrong code, the bank notifies you that it is not correct.
This campaign is from an affiliate program aimed at websites like ours and if you use the link provided (click here) and the promotional code (BACK), you will have €40.


The payment of the €40 (net, the bank is responsible for the IRPF withholdings), will be made over the 3 months following its opening by means of a credit in the same as “NEXT ACCOUNT – €40 ACTION ”.
NOTE: The promotion period is until October 16, 2022 and is subject to change. Check the validity of the promotion and the account conditions at the time of registration.
>> See more details of the promotion
The Next Account is now in the second step of the most profitable accounts on the market. Only behind Renault Bank which offers a 1% APR.
Orange Bank will have this same profitability from October 1, 2022.
What this bank really offers are 3 connected products: a checking account, a savings account and a debit card, very similar to what Orange Bank offers:
Of course, the bank asks that you meet one of the following 3 requirements to NOT pay commissions:
If you do not meet one of these 3 requirements, you will have to pay €8 per month in account maintenance fees.
The bank gives the bank a few months of grace, the account being exempt from commissions: the month of contracting and the following 3, even if you do not meet any of the conditions.
What we don't like is that the bank is moving money from your checking account to your savings account without your permission:
As indicated to us, this profitability is only for balances that exceed September 1, 2022; So if you are a customer and you are caught with a lot of money in this bank, that cash will only be remunerated at 0.05% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
TargoBank continues to offer its Amigo Plan, in which the client (sponsor) and the new client (sponsor) can each get €30 for signing up for the Next Account, a PRIME Subscription Account and/or a fixed-term deposit.
The Targo Bank Next Account has a very interesting interest rate, 2.53% APR, an interest rate set in the month of June.
Increase in the profitability of the Targo Bank Next Account, up to 2.53% APR, surpassing Renautl Bank (2.27% APR), N26 (2.26% APR) and similar to Banco Sabadell (2.5% TAE).
That 2.53% APR is for any amount of money, as long as you leave €100 in the payment account and without an upper limit."
534,"BFS rises to 1.7% APR, 1.6% APR in only 6 months",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-sube-hasta-el-17-tae-16-tae-a-solo-6-meses-de-plazo/,26/09/2022,"New rise in the profitability of BFS deposits. This time it affects short and long terms, ranging from 1.6% APR at 6 months to 1.7% APR at 3 years.
The most significant increase has been the 6-month term, and it has eliminated 2 fixed terms: the shortest, 3 months, and the longest, 5 years.
The current rates are several times what the bank was giving just half a year ago. The thing is that liquidity is at a premium lately and there are several banks that are fighting for it.
The fixed terms of this entity are as follows:
The characteristics of these products are:
The 6-month deposit does not allow early cancellation.
The bank accepts investments from €25,000. In this case, the profitability is 0.1 percentage points less than those indicated above.
The deposits offered are valid until October 2, 2022, and are exclusively for new hires.
These products have 2 disadvantages:
The entity is a Portuguese entity, it operates in Spain as an ING-style branch, with personal income tax withholdings, but under the Portuguese FGD.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
535,"Wow, Increase in Facto: 1% APR from 3 months, 2.25% APR from 6 months and up to 2.5% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wow-subidon-en-facto-1-tae-desde-3-meses-225-tae-desde-6-meses-y-hasta-25-tae/,24/09/2022,"Facto Account makes a real increase in the profitability of deposits, offering 1% APR from 3 months of term, through 2.25% APR from 6 months and up to 2.5% APR and from only 24 months of term.
In this way it becomes the entity that offers the most profitability for your money from very short term to very long term.
The downside of this entity is that it does not allow early cancellations, but giving you a 2.25% APR for 6 months, we do not think it will be a problem.
It is, without a doubt, at this time, the entity that offers the most for your money in all terms, it is a shame that its savings account is still at 0% APR.

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
The entity maintains its account without remuneration. It has been like this since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers before February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
536,"""Your ORANGE Account once again gives you more for your savings."" Do we accept octopus?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/tu-cuenta-naranja-vuelve-a-darte-mas-por-tus-ahorros-aceptamos-pulpo/,23/09/2022,"ING informs its customers that it is once again giving more for savings. Yes, it's true, but it was easy, too easy. They only gave you 0.01% APR and as long as you have a payroll account, because if you don't have it and you put in more than €30,000, they would give you a commission of €10 per month.
Well, all that is over. Starting November 1, these accounts will be remunerated at 0.3% APR and there will be no balance limits or conditions.
Did ING really benefit from this policy? Was it really worth the little commission he charged during this short period of time?
We have said ""no"" from day one, but ING will know what it is doing. A bank that was commission-free, but if the time comes, it does charge commissions. The end of a myth.
These conditions, as we already mentioned, will come into force as of November 1. Couldn't you have applied it already?

The ING payroll account continues with commissions (€3 per month) if you do not meet one of the following 2 conditions:
Those who choose the second option, be careful not to forget to make said transfer, you will get a surprise of €3 negative in your account.
Yes, ING came out with an alternative, the NoCuenta Account, and sold it as if it were a good thing for customers. What the bank really wanted was to collect commissions on its payroll account.
«We launched the 'NoCuenta Account' and reinforced our 'Payroll Account', a step with which we give customers more options to choose the one that best suits their needs. ""We know that, today, the freedom to choose is key and we are very proud to continue evolving hand in hand with clients to adapt to the context.""
Now, if you don't have the payroll account because you hate the conditions, you should switch to the NoCuenta account that has the services covered:
Now ING is just another bank, with commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
537,Last week to get €100 in Amazon Check if you sign up for 1 Wizink card,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ultima-semana-para-conseguir-100e-en-cheque-amazon-si-contratas-1-tarjeta-wizink/,22/09/2022,"Wizink plans to end the campaign in which it gives away €100 in an Amazon Check for signing up for one of its cards on September 30, 2022.
This campaign was scheduled to end on August 31, but the bank decided to extend it for 1 more month. We don't know if he will do it again.
The campaign has been in effect since June with significantly better conditions than previous campaigns (€60).
The requirements of the current campaign are:
Therefore, in addition to signing up, you must spend €450 in 3 months, which does not seem like much to us and the prize, €100, is worth it.
These cards are free and do not involve any cost to the customer, as long as they make sure NOT to finance their purchases, but rather pay in full at the end of the month.
Once the requirement has been met, and the entity has verified it, you will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €100 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Once the bonus has been collected, you can forget about the card, continue using it or cancel it. That's your decision.
If you decide to continue using it, you can get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
538,"The ING Orange Account will reward your money again, but only at 0.3% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-vuelve-a-remunerar-tu-dinero-pero-solo-al-03-tae/,21/09/2022,"ING will return to remunerate the money in the Orange Account, but only at 0.3% APR from November 1, 2022.
Another bank like Orange Bank announcing something in the future. The day you start applying it it will be an obsolete offer, although ING's really is already obsolete if we compare it with the 1% APR of MyInvestor, or the 1% APR of Renault Bank or the 0.7% APR of Orange Bank or even 0.6% APR from Pibank.
Likewise, it will eliminate the meaningless commissions that it had been applying to the Orange Account.
ING has been against the current in its latest movements such as the collection of commissions in the Orange account, the collection of commissions in the Payroll Account...
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission on the Orange Account unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.
NOTE: according to bank data, as of February, 14,000 clients have paid commissions (see here)
«We launched the 'NoCuenta Account' and reinforced our 'Payroll Account', a step with which we give customers more options to choose the one that best suits their needs. ""We know that, today, the freedom to choose is key and we are very proud to continue evolving hand in hand with clients to adapt to the context.""
Bullshit! What it does is force you to comply with the conditions of its payroll account or charge you commissions (€3 per month). If you do not want to pay commissions because you do not have payroll or because you do not feel like complying with their conditions, you have to go to the NoCuenta Account with the services covered:
The bank charges you €3 per month if you do not meet its conditions: enter a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit into the entity and you will have the Payroll Account at no cost.
If you don't have any of the above, nothing happens, you just have to make a monthly transfer of €700 to the account and that's it.
It is easy to do, but be careful, for those who are clueless who take advantage of the monthly transfer offer, if you forget to make that transfer one month you will pay €3


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.

There is therefore just over 1 week left to take advantage of this offer which requires the following conditions:
This campaign was launched in November 2021 and was initially set to expire on December 31, 2021 and was extended for periods of 3 months.

All of these offers are valid today.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

It will be the most profitable account and deposit on the market, and it has left us speechless.
This offer will last for 2 weeks, until October 4, 2022.
Your account now has the following characteristics:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
And your deposit:
Increases the profitability of your deposit from 0.5% APR to 0.7% APR.
It offers an extra return on its savings account, 0.5%, instead of 0.3%, to new customers.
It raises its deposit to 1.1% APR, which is more than what it offered when the bank was launched in Spain.
Your savings account changes to 0.45% APR for all customers without differentiation.
New increase in your deposit, this time up to the current 1.4% APR.
Also raise your savings account up to 0.55% APR, to beat Orange Bank which gives 0.5% APR
Vacation month, the bank does not make any changes.
As soon as the month of September starts, the bank increases the profitability of its account to 0.7% APR.
To this, Orange Bank reacts and applies a deferred increase to October 1 of its savings account of up to 0.7% APR. The same thing that Renault Bank now offers.
Renault Bank leaves its 24-month deposit unchanged at 1.4% APR.
On September 19, the bank makes the increase mentioned above: account at 1% APR and deposit at 1.81% APR
What will happen on October 5?


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
541,Orange Bank already announces on its website its next interest rate on your account: 0.7% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-ya-anuncia-en-su-web-su-proximo-tipo-de-interes-en-su-cuenta-07-tae/,19/09/2022,"Orange Bank already announces that the profitability of its savings account will be at 0.7% APR starting next October 1, leaving the maximum remunerated amount unchanged: €100,000
This announcement is already known to the bank's clients who received an email on September 5 with this information.
It is one of the few banks that we are aware of that makes announcements in this regard: a futures rate increase. This is done when you decide to lower or remove an offer.
In this way, starting October 1, both Orange Bank and Renault Bank will remunerate your money at 0.7% APR, unless tomorrow, Renualt Bank makes changes to its offer, which is its turn.
Thus, Orange Bank's new offer may be out of the picture even before it comes into force.
Renault Bank, which has been very active in recent months, knows where it can steal liabilities and clients, and they are those of Orange Bank and its changes in recent months are oriented in that direction.
In the month of July, Renault Bank raised its account to 0.55% APR, to beat Orange Bank and apparently they fell somewhat short, and on September 1 it raised it again to 0.7% APR, which along with its deposit at 1.4% APR, it is the clear winner.
Of course, Orange Bank offers a series of services that Renault Bank does not have: cards, direct debits, Bizum, instant transfers...
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
Finally, on October 1, the account will pay 0.7% APR and for a maximum of €100,000


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
544,What will Renault Bank offer starting next Tuesday? Now: 0.7% and 1.4% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/que-ofrece-a-partir-del-proximo-martes-renault-bank-ahora-07-y-14-tae/,15/09/2022,"Next Monday, September 19, the offer of 0.7% APR on your savings account and 1.4% APR on your 24-month deposit expires at Renault Bank. What will you offer the next day?
The entity has been very active since May with consecutive increases in the profitability of its savings products:
Increases the profitability of your deposit from 0.5% APR to 0.7% APR.
It offers an extra return on its savings account, 0.5%, instead of 0.3%, to new customers.
It raises its deposit to 1.1% APR, which is more than what it offered when the bank was launched in Spain.
Your savings account changes to 0.45% APR for all customers without differentiation.
New increase in your deposit, this time up to the current 1.4% APR.
Also raise your savings account up to 0.55% APR, to beat Orange Bank which gives 0.5% APR
Vacation month, the bank does not make any changes.
As soon as the month of September starts, the bank increases the profitability of its account to 0.7% APR.
To this, Orange Bank reacts and applies a deferred increase to October 1 of its savings account of up to 0.7% APR. The same thing that Renault Bank now offers.
Renault Bank leaves its 24-month deposit unchanged at 1.4% APR.
Both offers end on September 19.
It would be unthinkable that it would offer something worse, especially knowing what Orange Bank is going to do.
What I think most of us hope is that he extends his offer or improves it. What is your opinion? Leave us a comment.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
545,Banco Mediolanum launches the most profitable deposit on the Spanish market: at 2% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-mediolanum-lanza-el-deposito-mas-rentable-del-mercado-espanol-al-2-tae/,14/09/2022,"Banco Mediolanum launches a customer acquisition deposit, offering a 2% APR for 6 months to the entity's new customers.
It becomes the most profitable deposit of Spanish banks, surpassing EBN Banco (1.75% APR, see here); However, it has a big BUT.
If it weren't for this BUT, it would be even better, because it is a short term, 6 months, given the trend in the profitability of savings products.
But the bank requires that at the time of maturity, at least one of the deposit holders must be part of the MEDIOLANUM A TU MEDIDA program. And that makes it a deposit combined or linked to a lot of things (see below).
The entity allows a maximum investment of up to €50,000, so a new client could get €500 gross interest in that time in half a year, which is not bad at all.
This offer is exclusively for new customers starting August 1, 2022 and will last until December 31, 2022.
The characteristics of this deposit are:
The bank has limited the maximum deposits to 30 million euros.
That you have to have some investment fund, loan, credit, payroll...
In this way, we will classify this deposit within the combined or linked deposits, and it loses all its value.

Banco Mediolanum offers a deposit at 4% APR for 6 months for new clients, the same as Banco Big, but it has a big ""but"".
This entity requires that you have managed assets of at least €3,000 as of the deposit expiration date or have a payroll or pension deposited directly (minimum €700) at the end of the month prior to the deposit expiration.
Banco Mediolanum has increased the profitability of its Accounts to 2% APR, but like its deposit at 2% APR, it is not worth it.
They are temporary profitability, exclusively for new clients and for a limited amount.
According to the CEO of Banco Santander, José Antonio Alvarez, the entity is planning to charge for non-operational accounts (without movements), but always from companies and large corporations.
On the other hand, the interest rate on deposits continues to fall, and there are fewer and fewer options for savers. We indicate the best deposits."
546,"Tomorrow, last day of the offer €50 + 1% APR + 1% APR from the Sabadell Online Account",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/manana-ultimo-dia-de-la-oferta-50e-1-tae-1-tae-de-la-cuenta-online-del-sabadell/,14/09/2022,"Tomorrow the banking offer from Banco Sabadell ends, offering €50 net for opening an Online Account remunerated with 1% APR for a maximum of €30,000 and for 1 year.
Additionally, if you direct deposit a payroll or 3 receipts, you will receive an extra 1% APR of profitability in the account during that time.
We don't know what the bank will do, but it shouldn't get much worse, unless it has already attracted enough clients or spent the allocated budget.
To do? The current offer is very attractive, waiting for something much better, we do not think it is very likely. It is under your decision.
The history of the entity's offers in recent months in relation to this account have been:
In this second part of the promotion, there is a little mess. It is not a public offer that appears on its website, but rather the bank sends you an email after opening the Online Account.
Other users have told us that they have not been sent the email, but that by contacting the bank they have been granted it.
The payroll required is €700 and the 3 household bills can be for electricity, gas or mobile or landline telephones (they can be from your partner). These direct debits must be made before September 30 (the deadline may have changed).
Regarding remuneration, it applies to the average monthly account balances from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, inclusive, and will be settled monthly.
In total, it would be about €300 in interest, which without withholdings would be around €240 and €50 (net) welcome. In total, €290 net.
If you direct debit payroll or 3 receipts, you will charge €480 in interest + €50 welcome. In total, €530 net.

547,"EBN goes all out, increases its SinyCon Plus deposits, up to 1.75% APR; 1.5% APR for 1 year",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-va-por-todas-sube-sus-depositos-sinycon-plus-hasta-el-175-tae-15-tae-a-1-ano/,13/09/2022,"EBN Banco has increased the profitability of its deposits for 3 consecutive months:
We do not know what is happening in the entity, but if it makes so many increases it is because the previous offers have not been so attractive. In any case, it seems determined to capture all the liquidity possible.
The most interesting thing is the movement of 1-year deposits, which has taken a leap in quality:
Even shorter-term deposits are interesting: at 0.9% APR for a term as short as 4 months.
It was already the bank that offered the most interest on its deposits, now it is even better, and without such long terms.
The changes made affect all fixed terms, the shame is that these products are NOT cancelable in advance, but since they are already short terms, it may not matter as much.
YES deposits that can be canceled early have not been modified since July and offer a maximum of 0.7% APR.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are the same:
These deposits will be valid until October 12, 2022.
EBN is the first bank we have seen that does not allow customers to cancel their deposits, but the bank can do so.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
548,BBVA Va Contigo Account gives you €150 for direct debiting your payroll,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuenta-contigo-de-bbva-te-regala-150e-por-domiciliar-la-nomina/,12/09/2022,"BBVA launches a payroll campaign, offering a €150 bonus for opening an account.
This offer is better than Santander, which offers €100 per payroll (see here), although it is far from Abanca, which offers up to €300 (see here).
This campaign is NOT compatible with your friend plan and requires the following conditions:
The bonus is €150 gross (€121.5 net) which will be deposited into the account once compliance with the conditions has been verified.
In addition, the bank will help you with the BBVA Bank Exchange Service, so that you don't have to do anything. They will be in charge of moving your payroll, receipts or whatever you want.
The Va Contigo Account is commission-free:
As long as you meet one of the following conditions (if you meet the promotion requirements, you also meet the commission-free requirements):
If you do not meet these requirements, the account maintenance fee will be €160 per year in quarterly payments of €40.
BBVA offers new clients who open an account with the help of a client two bonuses:
For the friend plan, it is only necessary to sign up for your online account, which is also for new customers.
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
This account does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing, as we say, is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on their website.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
549,"ING continues to focus on payrolls, offering its clients €120 for direct debiting a",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-sigue-centrado-en-las-nominas-ofrece-a-sus-clientes-120e-por-domiciliar-una/,09/09/2022,"ING has launched a campaign to collect payroll from its clients who do not yet have it domiciled in the entity, offering them a welcome €120.
In this sense, it is communicating via email to its clients and requests the following points to give those €120 gross:
The €120 is gross, subject to withholding that the entity will credit to the account 1 week after the indicated conditions have been met.
NOTE: This promotion is only for ING clients without an open PAYROLL Account and who have also received the corresponding communication, either in their personal area of ​​the ING website, via email or push notification in their mobile app.

If this is not your case, you could try calling them and asking about this offer.
Yesterday we commented that ING is no longer what it was (see here), but this offer is somewhat similar to what it was.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
550,"ECB raises the interest rate by 0.75%, the highest in history, to 1.25%",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/bce-sube-el-tipo-de-interes-en-075-la-mayor-de-la-historia-hasta-125/,09/09/2022,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised the interest rate by 0.75%, the largest increase in history, to 1.25%.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
When we commented in April that the end of free money was approaching due to inflation (see here), we did not expect it to last so long.
Interannual inflation in the euro zone stood at 9.1% in August and a price increase of 8.1% is expected this year and 5.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024.
It represents the largest price increase in the entire historical series and more than four times the ECB's price stability goal of 2%.
The Euribor has been rising and rising since December, when it was -0.5%.
The month of August ended at 1,249%, the highest in a decade. An average mortgage of €150,000 and a 30-year term will mean an extra cost of €120 per month.
But that has only just begun, in recent days, the Euribor has been close to 2%, marking the provisional average for the month at 1.891%. If this continues, those same mortgages will increase by €175 per month.
Difficult times will return...
It is clear that if the Euribor, the interbank interest, rises, many banks will see that it is cheaper to finance themselves through savers.
What has been sold to us for years that banks could not pay interest on our money is over: Positive interest rate, Euribor around 1%...
The free money has now ended, and there is little justification left for ING or BBVA to continue charging for customer deposits. The lies that the banks have sold us in this time no longer hold up.
The deposit market, there are quite a few movements. We hadn't seen anything like this in a long time:
Be careful, many of these deposits are very long term. Our recommendation is not to commit yourself for a long time. Deposits will continue to rise.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has suddenly raised the interest rate to 0.5%, double what was expected.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
Due to inflation, the ECB will stop adding to its balance of debt purchases and will raise the price of money to 0.25% in July and will raise it again in September. It will be the first increase in 1 decade.
Free money ends, and banks will look for liquidity. Will they fight again for our money? Will deposits go up?
Inflation began to pick up in 2021 with the end of the COVID lockdown and a return to more or less normality.
But ever since Russia decided to invade Ukraine, the CPI has spiraled out of control. The latest data is 9.8%.
The Euribor is rising, will it pay for deposits again?"
551,ING offers its ING Amigo Plan until September 30: €40 bonus each,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-ofrece-su-plan-amigo-ing-hasta-el-30-de-septiembre-40e-de-bonificacion-a-cada-uno/,08/09/2022,"ING is launching its Amigo Plan again during the month of September with which it aims to attract new clients for its Payroll Account with the help of its existing clients.
Offers a €40 bonus to both the new customer (godson) and the existing customer (godfather).
The Dutch entity had been giving €50 for years with the Amigo Plan, but in 2022, it has cut the prize to €40, which after taxes is removed, remains at €32.4.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 400 euros gross.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
We believe that years ago it was unthinkable that ING would not offer deposits or profitability in its Orange Account or that it would charge you commissions.
Yes, the entity has not offered deposits for a long time, and charges commissions both on its Orange Account (unpaid or paid at 0.01% APR) and on its Payroll Account if you do not meet a series of conditions.
On November 12, 2020, a statement from ING said that: “we are living in an unusual economic time in which interest rates (which set the price of money) are falling relentlessly. So much so that they have been in the negative for years. A situation that forces us to make some changes in our ORANGE Account.
The bank justified itself in this way by charging clients commissions for depositing certain amounts of money in the Orange Account.
But the current situation is totally different. The Euribor is rising unstoppably since December 2022 when it reached a minimum of -0.502% (similar to 2020 when ING commissions were applied) to the current almost 1%, at the levels of July 2012. By the way , which at that time there were deposits of 2% and 3% normally, although the situation was different (crisis, lack of liquidity, etc., etc.). We'll see where the current situation is headed.
The price of money rose to 0.5% in the month of July. Oh, and the deposit facility, what banks pay to put money in the ECB, comes out of negative territory, which was at -0.5%, and stands at 0.00% and an imminent rise is expected .
The other banks are increasing the profitability of their products every week. But ING, in the midst of all this, releases a 'NoCuenta Account' that says it is an account without commissions and without conditions, but it limits the money you can deposit to €30,000 and limits some services.
If you want everything, you will have to sign up for the payroll account, but they force you to meet certain requirements or charge you commissions (€3 per month).

That is the way to control the amount they bet and the profits they obtain from them. If you are starting out, we are going to tell you some of the best-known strategies and how to use them so that you can start applying them today.
Strategies that work for roulette
Before starting with the strategies, the first thing you will have to do is determine where you are going to play. As you well know, there are countless online rooms today. To play live roulette you have to register at one of the many online casinos available in your country. And then, choose the type of roulette where you are going to bet, whether it will be an American, European, etc. style roulette. They are the same ones you find in a face-to-face casino as in the Las Vegas casinos.
After all this, here are some strategies to apply that will help you achieve success:
Martingale Strategy
The rules in this type of strategy are very simple. The moment you lose a bet, what you will have to do is double your bet in the next one.
That way, the moment you win again, you will recover what you have lost and you will have the desired balance again. To be able to apply this strategy you need to have money available and, above all, patience. Don't skip this simple rule because you could lose everything on the first bet.
Grand Martingale Strategy
Its name already tells us that it is similar to the previous one. The difference you will find here is that it is applied on a larger scale. This means that if you lose a bet, in the next one, what you will do is double it and add an extra so that the profits are greater.
Of course, if in the previous case you needed to have a certain amount of money available, in this strategy you are asked for even more to be able to sustain the streak until the winning bet appears.
Reverse Martingale Strategy
As its name indicates, what will be done in this case is to reverse the rules of the first strategy. That is, instead of doubling what you are going to bet when you lose a bet, it will be done when you win.
In order to see the profits you will have to have a winning streak, otherwise your bank will decrease considerably.
D'Alembert Strategy
If doubling a bet does not suit you much, then you should look for another option so that there is not as much risk. The D'Alembert strategy may be a perfect option for you. What he's talking about is that you start by betting one unit. If this one is lost, then in the next one what will be done is to bet two units. If correct, then one unit is reduced. For example, imagine that you are right on the first bet. Well, you keep your winnings and bet one unit again, and so on.
As you have seen, it is a much more conservative type of strategy than the others.
Fibonacci Strategy
Experts say that it is one of the safest strategies that exist to play roulette. Above all it is very functional for those who are a little more conservative in general. As its name indicates, it uses Fibonacci numbers to apply it.
The Fibonacci sequence is as follows: 1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21-34-55-89-144-233-377-610-987.
The strategy can be applied when betting on even numbers. You have to wait to win the first time to move on to the next. The moment you win the bet and move on to the next number, then you have to raise the bet by two. And if it is lost, everything starts from scratch.
James Bond Strategy
The idea of ​​this strategy is to bet a multiple of 200 in each round. Those 200 can be divided, for example, into three, betting a little on the numbers 13 to 18, 19 to 36, etc.
There is a third chance of losing so it is quite effective.
Other strategies for roulette
The above are some of the most used but they are not the only ones, you also have the following strategies that you can analyze and apply:
The best thing would be to try to see which of them you feel most comfortable with and thus optimize your type of bets each time.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun.

554,What's wrong with Wizink? Either he does something or he is thinking of closing,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/que-le-pasa-a-wizink-o-hace-algo-o-que-vaya-pensando-echar-el-cierre/,07/09/2022,"Wizink was one of the few banks that during the last few years of bank deposit drought offered something for our money, but now, it has fallen asleep. What happens?
It was together with Orange Bank, Pibank, MyInvestor, EBN Banco, BFS, Cuenta Facto... a refuge during or at some point in recent years for savers, where they could get some return on their money.
Everyone has updated their products:
But Wizink continues with its deposits:
And your savings account at 0.05% APR is totally outdated. If you continue like this for a long time, your accounts will remain at 0.
The only thing they hold back is that they do offer interesting types. If a deposit is going to expire, request non-renewal and try to take it to another entity, there will surely be a counteroffer.
We also miss an update in entities such as NN Bank, Openbank...


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
555,"TargoBank Next Account, another account at 0.7% APR with ifs and buts.",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuenta-proxima-de-targobank-otra-cuenta-al-07-tae-con-peros/,06/09/2022,"TargoBank offers its Next Account with a profitability of 0.7% APR. Another account at 0.7% APR such as Orange Bank or Renault Bank.
More specifically, it tries to emulate Orange Bank, since it offers a checking account, a savings account and a debit card, with very similar messages: ""A 3 in 1"" from TargoBank to ""3 solutions in 1 single pack"" from Orange Bank.
The account has many advantages, nothing out of the ordinary or that Orange Bank does not offer:
However, the Account Próxima offer has several dark points, unlike Orange Bank which does not have one. Of course, Orange Bank requires an Orange line to register, which many do not like at all (see here).
The most important is that in order for you to NOT have to pay commissions, you must meet one of the following 3 requirements:
If you do not meet one of these 3 requirements, you will have to pay €8 per month in account maintenance fees.
The bank gives the bank a few months of grace, the account being exempt from commissions: the month of contracting and the following 3, even if you do not meet any of the conditions.
The second but is that the bank is moving money from your checking account to your savings account without your permission:
As indicated to us, this profitability is only for balances that exceed September 1, 2022; So if you are a customer and you are caught with a lot of money in this bank, that cash will only be remunerated at 0.05% APR.


Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
TargoBank continues to offer its Amigo Plan, in which the client (sponsor) and the new client (sponsor) can each get €30 for signing up for the Next Account, a PRIME Subscription Account and/or a fixed-term deposit.
The Targo Bank Next Account has a very interesting interest rate, 2.53% APR, an interest rate set in the month of June.
Increase in the profitability of the Targo Bank Next Account, up to 2.53% APR, surpassing Renautl Bank (2.27% APR), N26 (2.26% APR) and similar to Banco Sabadell (2.5% TAE).
That 2.53% APR is for any amount of money, as long as you leave €100 in the payment account and without an upper limit."
556,Orange Bank takes a shot at Renault Bank and also rises to 0.7% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-le-echa-un-pulso-a-renault-bank-y-sube-tambien-al-07-tae/,05/09/2022,"Starting October 1, Orange Bank will raise its savings account to 0.7% APR, the same as what Renault Bank now offers.
It is a strange way to react to Renault Bank, which raised its account from 0.55% APR to 0.7% APR on September 1, 2022.
What is clear is that Renault Bank, which has been very active in recent months, knows where it can steal liabilities and clients, and they are those of Orange Bank.
In the month of July, Renault Bank raised its account to 0.55% APR, to beat Orange Bank and apparently they fell somewhat short, and on September 1 it raised it again to 0.7% APR, which along with its deposit at 1.4% APR, it is the clear winner.
Of course, Orange Bank offers a series of services that Renault Bank does not have: cards, direct debits, Bizum, instant transfers...
Orange Bank launched its account at 1% APR and for a maximum of €20,000 in November 2019. It was a profitable account at a time when no one offered anything for your money, they even wanted to charge you for lending to them.
On December 1, 2021, the bank reduced the profitability to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration to €40,000.
On July 1, 2022, the maximum remuneration increased again, up to €100,000.
Finally, on October 1, the account will pay 0.7% APR and for a maximum of €100,000


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
557,Wizink continues to give €100 in Amazon Check if you sign up for their card in September,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/wizink-sige-dando-100e-en-cheque-amazon-si-contratas-su-tarjeta-en-septiembre/,02/09/2022,"Wizink has finally decided to extend its €100 Amazon Check offer for signing up for one of its cards to the month of September.
In this sense, one of the promotional companies of the Wizink campaign has informed us: ""The 100 EUR Amazon check promo for the Wizink Cards program will remain active in September until further notice.""
And it reminds us that ""to make the promo effective, the user must make purchases for a minimum amount of 450 EUR during the first 3 months.""
The campaign has been in effect since June with significantly better conditions than previous campaigns (€60).
The conditions of the current campaign are:
Therefore, in addition to signing up, you must spend €450 in 3 months, which does not seem like much to us and the prize, €100, is worth it.
These cards are free and do not involve any cost to the customer, as long as they make sure NOT to finance their purchases, but rather pay in full at the end of the month.
Once the requirement has been met, and the entity has verified it, you will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €100 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Once the bonus has been collected, you can forget about the card, continue using it or cancel it. That's your decision.
If you decide to continue using it, you can get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.

The entity has increased the profitability of its Contigo Account from 0.55% APR to 0.7% APR and for an indefinite period, only surpassed by MyInvestor or Banco Sabadell (1% APR), whose offers are for a limited duration to 1 year.
Renault Bank has been very active since May, when it raised its account to 0.45% APR and its deposit to 1.1% APR.
Later, it went up one level, more. The account at 0.55% APR and your deposit at 1.4% APR, and it is now when the account rises again to 0.7% APR.

The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.

Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.

Both entities are the most active in recent months in terms of attracting customers based on the good profitability of their products.
In fact, we would almost bet on an improvement in the offer that they remove their promotions after the campaign ends today.
The best banking offer of the month of August is without a doubt that of Banco Sabadell, which offers €50 net for opening an Online Account remunerated with 1% APR for a maximum of €30,000 and for 1 year.
Additionally, if you direct deposit a payroll or 3 receipts, you will receive an extra 1% APR of profitability in the account during that time.
The payroll required is €700 and the 3 household bills can be for electricity, gas or mobile or landline telephones (they can be from your partner). These direct debits must be made before September 30.

564,Comparison of the 4 most profitable accounts for August 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/comparativa-las-4-cuentas-mas-rentables-de-agosto-de-2022/,25/08/2022,"It seems incredible, but during the month of August we have had 4 super profitable accounts: from 0.5% APR to 2% APR.
These are the accounts of Orange Bank, MyInvestor, Renault Bank and Banco Sabadell.
Orange Bank (0.5% APR) and MyInvestor (1% APR) have been 2 very profitable accounts for a long time when no one was giving anything for your money.
And not long ago, Renault Bank (0.55% APR) and especially Banco Sabadell (1% APR, and up to 2% APR) came in strongly, offering very interesting returns.
MyInvestor raised its remunerated limit to 1% APR from €15,000 to €20,000 and allows its clients to extend this profitability indefinitely after the initial 12 months if they invest at least €300 per month in the entity's investment products. : indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
The 4 accounts give much more than most deposits and with the great advantage of having liquid money, super important at this time when the savings market is on a growing trend.
During the first year of being a customer, the clear winner is Banco Sabadell and its recent offer at 1% APR and for up to a maximum of €30,000 and if you direct debit a payroll or 3 receipts, it will give you an extra 1% APR. In addition, it welcomes you to the bank with €50 net.
MyInvestor also offers a 1% APR, but limits it to €20,000 of investment.
Starting in the second year, the standout offer is Renault Bank, which offers its account at 0.55% APR without limits. In addition, it sells a deposit at 1.4% APR (see here).
Orange Bank would lose a position in favor of Renual Tabnk by giving 0.5% APR for an indefinite period and for the newly updated limit of up to €100,000.
MyInvestor would be the most profitable indefinitely as long as you invest €300 in its indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
We see that the most complete (more services) is Orange Bank.
*It is for an indefinite period if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
*Sabadell gives an extra 1% APR if you direct debit a payroll or 3 receipts
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
You should take advantage of the MyInvestor and Banco Sabadell promotions. A 1% APR is still an excellent return compared to what is on the market.
As an account, the best is Orange Bank, due to its services and profitability.
We should not rule out Renault Bank either, we do not recommend simply putting the money in the account, but rather taking advantage of its deposit at 1.4% APR, one of the best on the market.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

567,Online casinos or sports betting: What do Mexicans prefer?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/casinos-online-o-apuestas-deportivas-que-prefieren-los-mexicanos/,23/08/2022,"Mexico is one of the countries with the largest number of users of online gaming sites and casinos in Latin America. Online casinos have understood the tastes of Mexican players.
In almost all the casinos that operate in Mexico, we can see how they seek to highlight these characteristics so that players continue betting real money on their platforms.
To let you know what the main preferences and tastes of the Mexican market are for casino games, at PrivateCasinos we wrote this review so that you understand a little better how the betting markets work in Mexico, check out our site with information on online poker Mexico .
The best new online casinos have taken advantage of the different types of bets that you can find on their portals. The best casinos have the two important sectors of online betting. Sports betting is one of the most sought after by Mexican players; and online casino games in different types of games, in addition to the various titles and providers on the market.
Technological advances have meant that players can be connected at any time from their mobile phone, very important if you want to cover sports betting in different leagues around the world, whether you bet in advance or moments before the game starts.
While gambling has advanced as well, using applications optimized for gaming and also being able to play with a live dealer at any time.
Mexican players have well-defined preferences when playing for real money in online casinos. When they want to bet on sports markets, they tend to mainly choose soccer in one of the most important leagues, whether in Mexico, Europe or international tournaments.
The markets are the types of bets that you can place on a certain match or contest from anywhere; For example, in soccer, you can choose how many goals there will be per game, who will win or who will score first. In other major sports such as boxing, players in Mexico often bet on the winner, manner of victory and which round it will end in.
The other sector of players are those who prefer more classic games, adapted to the functionality of technology. An article by PrivateCasinos observed that the games most popular with users are slot machines; So a casino with a vast gaming offering will have to offer a significant number of slot games on its betting sites.
The other types of games that are attractive to players are live games. At these tables you can enjoy many of the games that the casino offers, such as poker, blackjack and roulette among others. This type of game gives security to the Mexican player, since he feels confident and as if he were in a real casino, sitting with a dealer to whom he can write and have more users in the same room to coexist.
Entering the realm of online casinos like Rabona casino can be an experience full of excitement and fun. However, beyond the entertainment, there are valuable lessons about managing personal finances. Each decision made in roulette or blackjack, for example, contains strategies applicable not only in the game, but also in our daily finances.
In the wide universe of online gaming, Nomini Casino shines as an oasis of fun and excitement. In an environment where the daily routine can be tedious, having a trustworthy and entertaining space to relax is essential.
With a wide variety of games ranging from the most popular slots to classic table games, this online casino offers a unique gaming experience for every type of player.
Casinos are popular places for those looking for excitement and entertainment, but they are also known for their mathematical advantage in all online casino or sportsbook games."
568,Last week to get €100 in Amazon Check by signing up for 1 Wizink card,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ultima-semana-para-conseguir-100e-en-cheque-amazon-contratando-1-tarjeta-de-wizink/,23/08/2022,"Wizink plans to close its promotional campaign in which it gives away €100 in an Amazon check if you sign up for a Wizink card, completely free, and use it on August 31.
You have 1 week, in addition to the remainder of today, to take advantage of this offer and we do not know if it will finally be extended.
The campaign has been in effect since June with significantly better conditions than previous campaigns (€60).
The previous €60 cash campaign lasted a long time, but between the current campaign and that one, another promotion that was much worse in our opinion was in force, in which it only offered cashback (it means that you have to spend) as a bonus.
We believe that the bank will exchange both campaigns.
The conditions of the current campaign are:
Therefore, in addition to signing up, you must spend €450 in 3 months, which does not seem like much to us and the prize, €100, is worth it.
These cards are free and do not involve any cost to the customer, as long as they make sure NOT to finance their purchases, but rather pay in full at the end of the month.
Once the requirement has been met, and the entity has verified it, you will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €100 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Once the bonus has been collected, you can forget about the card, continue using it or cancel it. That's your decision.
If you decide to continue using it, you can get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
569,Hasn't the Treasury refunded me yet? Understand the status of your income tax return,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/aun-no-me-ha-devuelto-hacienda-entiende-el-estado-de-tu-declaracion-de-la-renta/,22/08/2022,"The 2021 income campaign ended on June 30, but there are still many taxpayers who have not received their refund.
The Treasury has until December 30 to pay you, and it could even be delayed longer, however, from that date it will pay you late payment interest.
If you are impatient or if you want to know what is happening, you can check the status of your refund on the Tax Agency's website, but be careful, not because you filed early or late has any influence on how quickly you would collect the refund; It is random.
The different phases are 5:
The declaration has been submitted, but the Crushing Agency has not yet reviewed it.
In this phase, the Treasury is verifying your details and checking if there are any errors.
It does not mean that you have found any discrepancy. You are simply checking it, and it is the status of most of the unreturned returns.
There is something wrong with the statement. You should contact them to correct the error.
The statement has been verified and is considered correct. You will get paid soon.
You will collect the return within 10 days.
The only state in which you should worry would be 3, because it means that there is something in the declaration that is not right and the Treasury will begin an investigation and verification process.
A parallel statement could derive from this.
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."
570,Openbank now offers a 2% discount if you buy an Amazon Check,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/openbank-ofrece-ahora-un-descuento-del-2-si-compras-un-cheque-amazon/,19/08/2022,"First was the defunct COINC that offered a 4% discount for the purchase of an Amazon Check.
Then Evo Banco, which has been intermittently offering a similar offer, currently offers a 2.5% bonus.
Now, Openbank is also launching an offer of this type. Specifically, it offers you a 2% discount on the purchase of these checks through its ""Open Markets.""
If you buy a check for €100, you will pay €98. It's not a big deal, but it's free.
The way to make the purchase is simple and can be through your Website or App:

Evo Banco now offers its clients 2 deposits per balance increase at 2.85% APR and 2.95% APR depending on the term, 6 or 3 months.
The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.
This product has no commissions of any kind. It is only contractable for money coming from another entity other than Evo Banco."
571,Bank Norwegian now offers its Savings Account at 0.5% APR as Orange Bank,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bank-norwegian-ofrece-ahora-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-al-05-tae-como-orange-bank/,18/08/2022,"The Norwegian Bank, Norwegian, has recently offered a savings account at 0.5% APR and for a maximum of €100,000, very similar to what Orange Bank offers.
However, there are important differences:
It is just a Savings Account, in the style of the ING Orange Account, with the difference that it is among the most profitable on the market:
Account opening can be done both from your APP and from the entity's website.
The characteristics of the account are;
It is not surprising that the IBAN begins with NO. We have already mentioned that it does not have a branch in Spain and therefore, the account is from Norway.
The money is guaranteed by Norway's FGD, which is the same as in Spain: €100,000 per bank and per client.
At the beginning of February, in your Client Area, the entity will provide you with the annual declaration of your account for what you take into account in the income tax return.
Until recently it offered only 0.25% APR and we did not consider it interesting to comment on this entity, but by raising it to 0.5% APR, it at least deserves a mention on www.tucapital.es.
We believe that unless you have more than €100,000 and don't know where to put it, it is an alternative. Otherwise, we think Orange Bank or Renault Bank are better; at least, less with less complications.


Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.7% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
The Norwegian Bank, Bank Norwegian, increases the profitability of its account by one tenth of a point more, to 3.7% APR, 0.2 percentage points more.
It is one of the most profitable on the market for liquid money.
Bank Norwegian increases the profitability of your account up to 3.5% APR and is the most profitable on the market, without asking for demands, conditions and without commissions.
It surpasses Renault Bank (2.89% APR) by more than half a point or EBN Banco (3% APR for €10,000) and even surpasses the accounts offered by some collaborating banks on the Raisin platform, such as CKV (3.3% APR ), Klarna (3.29% APR) or Distingo (3.20% APR)."
572,"Today is the last day of ING's Twyp, it will close tomorrow. You have 1 month to withdraw your money",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/twyp-de-ing-echa-el-cierre-hoy-tienes-1-mes-para-retirar-tu-dinero/,17/08/2022,"Twyp, ING's payment service, will close tomorrow, Thursday, August 18. Customers have just over 1 month, until September 19, to withdraw their money from the application.
Today will be the last day that users of this application, not all of whom are ING clients, will be able to send, receive and share expenses only using their mobile number.
In this way, tomorrow, it will end a service that has lasted 7 years (since 2015) and that ING was a pioneer.
This is an example of how a service that was better from a theoretical point of view fails in favor of another because it had much more support. As ING continues doing nonsense... (see here)
That other application is Bizum, a similar platform, but created by the majority of Spanish banks and 1 year after Twyp, in 2016.
Both applications have coexisted throughout this time, but the end of Twyp was clear since the entity itself, ING, under pressure from its clients, allowed them to use Bizum in 2020.
The reception of Bizum by its clients was such that in just 3 months, 400,000 of its clients signed up, which was more than 15% of all ING clients at that time.
Despite the closure of Twyp, ING customers could continue to enjoy this service, because this functionality will be integrated directly into the ING application.
It will therefore be even more convenient for ING customers. The downside, always, is that they force you to make a purchase in these stores, tobacconists and other establishments (30,000):
From a functional point of view, Twyp was better than Bizum, because an application not associated with a bank and allows any customer of any bank to use it.
On the other hand, Bizum is a functionality within the electronic banking of a specific bank, and that allows you to do the same with any other client with Bizum, regardless of the bank to which it belongs.
The problem with Bizum is that you had to be from a bank that was a member. But it is not so much of a problem when 96% of the banks are members.
The difficulties were faced by the clients of a bank outside this platform, such as ING, and who finally had no choice but to accept and join.
If you are a customer of any bank (the majority) and you use their APP, and therefore, you are already a potential Bizum customer. On the other hand, if you want Twyp, you have to find out about its existence and want to download it.
When ING integrated Bizum, there were just over 1 million users with the Twyp application, while Bizum had close to 12 million.

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
573,"With the current interest rates and Euribor, shouldn't ING eliminate commissions?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/con-el-actual-tipos-de-interes-ing-no-deberia-eliminar-comisiones/,16/08/2022,"On November 12, 2020, a statement from ING said that: “we are living in an unusual economic time in which interest rates (which set the price of money) are falling relentlessly. So much so that they have been in the negative for years. A situation that forces us to make some changes in our ORANGE Account.
The bank justified itself in this way by charging clients commissions for depositing certain amounts of money in the Orange Account if they do not meet one of the following conditions:
The Orange Account will continue without commissions, without limits and is remunerated at 0.01% APR:
The bank lets you deposit up to €30,000 in the Naranaj Account and does not charge you anything. If you exceed the amount and do not have the Payroll Account, they charge you a €10 commission per month.
The Euribor is rising unstoppably since December 2022 when it reached a minimum of -0.502% (similar to 2020 when ING commissions were applied) to the current almost 1%, at the levels of July 2012. By the way , which at that time there were deposits of 2% and 3% normally, although the situation was different (crisis, lack of liquidity, etc., etc.). We'll see where the current situation is headed.
The price of money rose to 0.5% in the month of July. Oh, and the deposit facility, what banks pay to put money in the ECB, comes out of negative territory, which was at -0.5%, and stands at 0.00%.
That is, for lending the money to ING, ING charges you if you do not comply with its conditions. You take that money and you can do several things:
What a bargain!
Well, knowing that the ECB is going to raise interest rates, it makes this statement: «We launched the 'NoCuenta Account' and reinforced our 'Payroll Account', a step with which we give clients more options to choose the one that best suits them. to your needs. ""We know that, today, the freedom to choose is key and we are very proud to continue evolving hand in hand with clients to adapt to the context.""
Bullshit! What it does is force you to comply with the conditions of its payroll account or charge you commissions (€3 per month). If you do not want to pay commissions because you do not have payroll or because you do not feel like complying with their conditions, you have to go to the NoCuenta Account with the services covered:
You just have to enter a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit into the entity and you will have the Payroll Account at no cost.
If you don't have any of the above, nothing happens, you just have to make a monthly transfer of €700 to the account and that's it.
In short, it is a ""shit"" condition, easy to meet and the bank gains nothing. Didn't they say that they don't want money in your accounts and that's why they charge? Is that why you ruin your ""commission-free"" reputation?
…And for what, to charge the few absent-minded people who will forget to make that transfer one month and earn €3?
It will happen like with the commissions of the Orange Account, which in its first year only affected 14,000 clients of its several million (see here). That's why you ""screw"" your commission-free reputation!
Now many will criticize us for saying this... but we have been clients of ING since its inception, back at the beginning of the millennium, and we have seen how over the years, it has gradually deteriorated, and we have commented on it to throughout this time.
ING says: “ING has something that I like.” We corrected him: ""ING had something that he liked"" (we already wrote it in 2020, see here). Now, it is already in a predominant situation, it is more like the usual banks, and even worse.
Santander, Sabadell and BBVA are banks feared for their commissions and changes in conditions and no one trusts them.
We don't believe they have changed and at the first opportunity it will annoy us again; but right now they offer accounts with all the services and without conditions. Even Sabadell gives you up to cash and returns on your money for 1 year (see here).
None of these banks forces you to be with them in perpetuity. Take advantage of its good conditions now, and if it changes, leave.
The same as with ING, which has been providing very good conditions for several decades, but now they are not. Go to a better one, and if things change, you can come back.

Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

It had been without this offer since May, and previously we would have to go back to December 2021 (then only €20) and December 2020.
This offer is exclusively for the first 1,000 new customers to meet the conditions. In May it was for the first €2,000. This condition does not seem serious to us.
The process to join the offer is simple:
Before October 31, 2022, the entity will deposit €40 into your account, if you are one of the first 1,000, of course.

The issuance and renewal of additional cards for other cardholders will cost €18 per card per year.

Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

It is a much less aggressive offer than Banco Sabadell's offer (€50 and 1% APR for 1 year, see here), but at the end of the day it gives you money for something that is free.
Specifically, BBVA offers:
This offer was activated on February 1, 2022 and has been in effect intermittently. This time, it will be until October 31, 2022.
All BBVA customers can join the plan and start inviting their friends and get a bonus of up to €350.
>> See legal bases of the promotion
During the registration process, the new client must indicate the promotional code given by his sponsor.
Godparents can obtain this code in the entity's electronic banking.
If you don't have a friend with an account or if you are a customer with an account, you can request a code in the comments below or provide yours.
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, you can hire it, but you will surely be left out of the Amigo Plan and perhaps some more disadvantages.

BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
577,Facto Account also increases the profitability of your deposits in the short and medium term,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/cuenta-facto-sube-tambien-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-a-corto-plazo/,09/08/2022,"Facto Account returned in June to offer profitability on its deposits (previously at 0.1% APR), reaching up to 1.4% APR. Then we said that its “high profitability” was only for the long term.
In the short term, their offer was still ridiculous. Thus, at 1 year it gave only 0.25% APR. Well, the bank has corrected that in a certain way yesterday.
Now, starting with terms of 180 days, the bank offers a profitability of 0.5% APR, which we still don't like, especially since its deposits do not allow early cancellation.
In addition, you can have liquid money and at that profitability in Orange Bank or Renault Bank. But it is a symptom that this entity does not want to be left behind in this new stage of rate hikes.
It has also slightly improved the intermediate terms from between 1 year to 3 years:

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.
The entity maintains its account without remuneration. This has been the case since June 28, 2021. Then it gave 0.2% APR to customers prior to February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
578,Wizink asks from today to spend €450 with their card so that they can give you €100 in an Amazon check,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/wizink-pide-desde-hoy-gastar-450e-con-su-tarjeta-para-que-te-de-los-100e-en-cheque-amazon/,08/08/2022,"Starting today, August 8, the minimum expense that the new customer must make to get the €100 Amazon check will be at least €450, instead of €300.
In this way, the conditions to access the promotion are as follows:
It didn't seem like that much of a problem for us to spend the €300 we used to, or the €450 now for 3 months. And the prize, €100, is worth it.
We also remind you that Wizink has set August 31 as the end date of its promotional campaign.
The campaign has been in effect since June with a significantly better bonus than previous campaigns (€60).
The previous €60 cash campaign lasted a long time, but between the current campaign and that one, another promotion that was much worse in our opinion was in force, in which it only offered cashback (it means that you have to spend) as a bonus.
We believe that the bank will exchange both campaigns.
This card is free and does not involve any cost to the customer, as long as they make sure NOT to finance their purchases, but rather pay in full at the end of the month.
Once the requirement has been met, and the entity has verified it, you will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €100 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Once the bonus has been collected, you can forget about the card, continue using it or cancel it. That's your decision.
If you decide to continue using it, you can get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion and conditions are in force at the time of signing up. As of the date of publication of this article, these are the conditions, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
579,EBN maintains profitability of up to 0.7% APR on its YES cancelable deposits,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-mantiene-en-el-07-tae-sus-depositos-si-cancelables/,08/08/2022,"Since the beginning of July, EBN has been marketing 2 ranges of deposits: one with the possibility of early cancellation, less profitable; and another without that possibility, but more profitable.
The difference in profitability between both deposits is considerable, and is increasingly trending higher. It is clear that the bank wants to have your money for a long time for whatever may come.
It is a safe bet for the bank, because it forces its clients to have their money in the bank for a long time, but at the same time if interest rates do not rise as they think, it has the power to cancel these deposits.
In this way, for example, for the same 12-month term, EBN gives only 0.3% APR if you want to have the possibility of early cancellation, and if not, 1% APR. Much difference:
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are the same:
EBN is the first bank we have seen that does not allow customers to cancel their deposits, but the bank can do so.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
580,Wizink will only give €100 on Amazon until August 31 for signing up for its card,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/wizink-dara-solo-hasta-el-31-de-agosto-100e-en-amazon-por-contratar-su-tarjeta/,05/08/2022,"Wizink sets August 31 as the end date of its promotional campaign in which it gives away €100 in an Amazon check if you sign up for its Wizink Now card, completely free, and use it.
In this sense, we have been informed and we do not know if it will finally be extended.
The campaign has been in effect since June with significantly better conditions than previous campaigns (€60).
The previous €60 cash campaign lasted a long time, but between the current campaign and that one, another promotion that was much worse in our opinion was in force, in which it only offered cashback (it means that you have to spend) as a bonus.
We believe that the bank will exchange both campaigns.
The offer is aimed at new card customers, who must register and make purchases or cash withdrawals with your card for a minimum amount of €300 during the first 3 months from the date of granting.
We don't think it's that much of a problem to make expenses of €300 in 3 months, and the prize, €100, is worth it.

In this way, it becomes the Spanish entity that offers the highest interest rate for our savings, perhaps a little long in time: 3 years.
The interesting thing is that it offers a 1% APR for a term of 1 year, and even gives a good interest rate (0.6% APR) for a term as short as 3 months.
The changes affect almost all of your deadlines. The bad thing about these products is that they cannot be pre-ordered.
The entity is informing its clients of this increase via SMS and the interest rates are already listed on its website.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are the same:
Yesterday we commented on their cancelable deposits, which were not sufficiently profitable, looking at the products of Renault Bank (see here) or Orange Bank (see here).
Today, after the relaunch, EBN remains close in profitability, but not being able to cancel and the bank being able to do so, is not liked at all, but not at all among savers.

I could have put ING in the headline, but this entity has not given anything in recent years and its trend is even worse:
1. Commission for saving your money
It is one of the few banks that has charged a commission because a customer has deposited money in the bank.
Specifically, if you deposit more than €30,000 in the Orange Account and you do not have a payroll account, you have to pay €10 per month.
As we learned, as of February 2022, 14,000 clients paid commissions for this concept (see here), we imagine that this number will have grown since then.
2. Commissions in online account
When the rest of the large banks (online and offline) and not to mention the small ones, market or begin to market online accounts without commissions and without conditions, ING makes its online accounts with almost no services or with conditions or with commissions.
We talked about your newly created No Account account and your new Payroll Account conditions.
If you don't want any ties, the Account Doesn't Count. But you will have the services covered (see here).
If you want all the services, you will need to do something, little, but you have to do something to avoid having to pay €3 commission per month (see here). The problem with having to do something is that one month goes by, and wham, €3 less in the account.
3. An eternity without deposits
In 2018, ING only gave 0.04% APR for its famous and super-profitable Orange deposits (see here), it had been offering ridiculous rates for some time.
Finally, in 2020, it removed this iconic product (see here).
Wizink, like Orange Bank, Pibank, MyInvestor, EBN Banco, BFS, Cuenta Facto..., has been a refuge during or at some point in recent years for savers, where they could get some return on their money.
Everyone has updated their products, but Wizink, nothing. We already said (see here) in May that it was falling behind, and nothing has changed.
Your deposits:
They are far, far away from the most profitable ones that reach up to 1.4% APR, such as Cuenta Facto or Renault Bank.
And your savings account at 0.05% APR is completely outdated, with banks offering 0.5% APR or even 1% APR (see here).
We also miss an update in entities such as NN Bank, Openbank...


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
583,The most profitable savings accounts for August 2022: many changes,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-cuentas-de-ahorro-mas-rentables-de-agosto-2022-muchos-cambios/,02/08/2022,"In the last 2 months, the landscape of savings accounts has changed a lot.
Some entities continue to maintain their ""pre-war"" offers from Ukraine (to give a name) and they are embarrassing if you compare it with the new offers.
Now we have again 2 banks that offer your money at 1% APR and another 2 have improved their offers.
These are MyInvestor and Banco Sabadell that give 1% APR for your money, however, it limits it to 1 year and for a money limit: €20,000 (before €15,000) and €30,000 respectively. In addition, Sabadell gives you €50 as a welcome gift.
Orange Bank has also improved, allowing you to put up to €100,000 (previously €50,000) at 0.50% APR.
Renault Bank raised its offer to 0.45% APR, and then to 0.55% APR (from 0.3% APR).
If you compare the profitability of these banks, compared to those that still maintain the offers of yesteryear, the difference is big, very big.
The other 4 banks in the comparison, 2 have improved their bank deposits and another 2 have done absolutely nothing.
In the case of Pibank, the entity has improved the profitability of its deposit, up to double (0.5% APR), but maintains the savings account as it was.
EBN has relaunched its deposits with returns of up to 1.15% APR.
The most profitable accounts on the market in force this month of August are:
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months. If you invest in their investment products you can maintain that 1% APR or else, at 0.1% APR
*Banco Sabadell offers 1% APR only to new customers for 12 months, then nothing


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
584,Sabadell further improves its Online account offer: €50 + 1% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/sabadell-mejora-aun-mas-su-oferta-de-cuenta-online-50e-1-tae/,01/08/2022,"We did not expect it, but Banco Sabadell has even improved its offer for acquiring your online account.
Now it offers new clients who hire it, €50 welcome and remunerates them at 1% APR for 1 year for a maximum of €30,000.
The history of this promotion that has only been in effect for 3 months has been:
Will it continue to improve? Nothing is going to surprise us anymore.
To benefit, you just have to be a new Banco Sabadell customer and register, you have until August 31, 2022, and deposit up to €30,000 in the account so that it begins to produce interest.
Please note that the remuneration applies to the average monthly account balances from September 1, 2022 to August 31, 2023, inclusive, and will be settled monthly.
In total, it would be about €300 in interest, which without withholdings would be around €240 and €50 (net) welcome. In total, €290 net.
The payment of €50 will be made within 5 days after opening the account.

This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

The previous campaign that offered €100 for opening an account and using your card once was only valid in the month of June, and we do not know if the campaign will be extended next Monday.
It is a good offer and if you do not have an ""allergy"" to Banco Sabadell you still have time to take advantage of the promotion.
To benefit, you just have to register, you have until July 31, 2022, and deposit up to €30,000 in the account so that it begins to produce interest.
In total, it would be about €300 of interest, which without withholdings would be around €240.

This offer is a clear sign that liquid money is no longer free. Sabadell's campaign was even better than Orange Bank or MyInvestor in recent years.

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
587,3 cryptocurrency investment options that you should know about for the coming months,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/3-opciones-de-inversion-con-criptomonedas-que-debes-conocer-para-los-proximos-meses/,27/07/2022,"Are you looking for new cryptocurrencies to make an investment in? With the progressive rise of the world of cryptocurrencies, today the options are diverse.
This sometimes leads many to invest in currencies that are not in a good moment or even to lose the opportunity to invest in one that is about to take a significant leap.
That is why we tell you what are 3 investment options with cryptocurrencies so that you have a more specific filter and can put your money in a more promising project.
Let's get into three main currencies. Now, the coins we will talk about will not be the usual hidden gems but will be something different from what everyone probably already owns and knows about.
The reason we recommend them is because these coins have stood the test of time and have proven that they can survive a cryptocurrency winter. Continue reading this article and learn about these 3 options that we have analyzed for you and your next investment.
KuCoin is a cryptocurrency platform, an exchange, that is achieving great popularity in recent months. For starters, KuCoin's fees are very low, just 0.1% per transaction, and if you pay through the platform's native token, the KuCoin Token, you can get a 20% discount. This is not all, and KuCoin has many advantages apart from low commissions. It is a very secure platform with a double verification system to protect its users. Investors will be able to trade more than 700 different assets on KuCoin. All these features and many more are what led KuCoin to be named the best cryptocurrency exchange in 2021 according to Forbes Advisor.
So to put into perspective how much trading volume they have compared to other exchanges, if you combined Coinbase, Kucoin and FTX is a 24 hour trading volume, we would be talking about around $4.45 billion. It is true that the market fell slightly, but it is recovering little by little. And the reason is that Kucoin, the cryptocurrency exchange, has surpassed $2 trillion in trading volume in the first half of 2022. This is a 180% increase compared to the same period in 2021. Kucoin is an intermediary company . Now, a great way to compare this is to the gold rush that America had in the 1800s, where it was the people who sold the shovels who made all the money, not the people who moved across the country to look for it. And I think this is exactly what we are seeing with Binance. You are making a lot of money, whichever way the cryptocurrency market goes, because they are the middlemen. Whether you want to buy or sell, you have to go to Binance. You can't go anywhere else.
While everyone else is running and fighting to keep their lights on in the cryptocurrency market, Kucoin is going cold and that is why it is very certain that they will do really well in the future.
Even though the cryptocurrency market is down, KuCoin has taken a different way to show its bullish trend. The cryptocurrency exchange has surpassed $2 trillion in trading volume in the first half of 2022. This is a 180% increase compared to the same period in 2021.
The KCS token is an innovative way for KuCoin to share 50% of the platform's trading revenue with token holders on the exchange. All KuCoin users who own at least 6 KCS are entitled to earn a daily dividend of 50% of KuCoin's income from trading commissions. In addition to receiving rewards in the form of revenue sharing, KCS holders also enjoy commission discounts and the opportunity to participate in initial token offerings and other exclusive services offered by KuCoin.
Now, looking at Ethereum in 2017 and 2018, we can see that it fell hard from $1,400 to $85. But then it returned to its all-time high of around $900.
These types of movements are what invite you to invest in cryptocurrencies that have gone through these horrible collapses since what continues at the moment is a recovery and possible break of the all-time high.
A clear example is that of Bitcoin in 2018 and as it lost more than 90% of its value, however, it still managed to reposition itself. That's what we're going to look for here. And I think Ethereum will do exactly that. Once again, Ethereum sits just above $1,000 right now, and was recently in the news for successfully merging its ETH 2.0 test model.
Thanks to this, investments will grow for Ethereum solidly. There will no longer be a need for miners, which is very bad for the environment. And because of that, a lot of people in large corporations were actually holding off investing in Ethereum because it would give them a bad reputation.
But when the merger happens and we finally go to ETH 2.0, all those miners will go offline and will no longer be needed. This will now allow companies to justify investing in ETH because it is more socially acceptable. Now. The second reason is that the staking rewards will increase a lot with this merger.
Right now you can get around 3-5% when staking Ethereum, but when this merger happens, we're looking at double-digit returns, close to 10% for just taking your Ethereum. And with those returns, I can almost guarantee that a lot of people will move to Ethereum just so they can get that big bet reward and earn that passive income.
And finally, we have Cardano or Ada. And yes, I know Cardano has a bad reputation, but let's face it, it's been here since 2017, so it gets OG status. For me, he got the bad rap from him with the sharp collapse of 2018, but he also got the big rise we saw last year to $3.10. Now, there are a lot of people out there who hate Cardano for not reaching $10 because there was a lot of news about it a couple of months ago. But frankly, you shouldn't listen to those people because they are just short-term players trying to make a quick buck in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are an asset class that we must believe in, but for the long term.
Since Cardano is open source, developers can fix or improve the code, then the community can vote to implement these changes or not and Cardano has been doing amazing. Last month, the community had 350 commits, while projects like Ethereum and Solana only had around 270.
This is pretty surprising because they had the most in 2021 and no one was talking about it. If we also look at Cardano insights, we can see that the community is thriving, wallet voting is increasing year on year and more votes are also being cast every year. So there are a lot of good things for Cardano right now that a lot of people aren't talking about.
These have been the three highlighted currencies in this article: KCS, Ethereum and Cardano. You can make big profits by investing in coins that have proven themselves during tough times, because you are sure that they will exist for the long term.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.

588,Do you want €100 on Amazon? You just have to sign up for the Wizink card and use it,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/quieres-100e-en-amazon-solo-tienes-que-contratar-la-tarjeta-wizink-y-usuarla/,26/07/2022,"Getting €100 in an Amazon check is as simple as requesting the Wizink Now card, completely free, and using it. Of course, you must be a new card customer.
The other condition that is asked of you is that you must make purchases or cash withdrawals with your card for a minimum amount of €300 during the first 3 months from the granting of the card.
We don't think it's that much of a problem to make expenses of €300 in 3 months, and the prize, €100, is worth it.
This card is free and does not involve any cost to the customer, as long as they make sure NOT to finance their purchases, but rather pay in full at the end of the month.
Once the requirement has been met, and the entity has verified it, you will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €100 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Once the bonus has been collected, you can forget about the card, continue using it or cancel it. That's your decision.
If you decide to continue using it, you can get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
589,Foreign banks overcome the 2% APR barrier for your money,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/la-banca-extranjera-supera-la-barrera-del-2-tae-por-tu-dinero/,25/07/2022,"Through the Raisin platform, Banco Progetto already offers a 3-year deposit with a profitability of 2.09% APR, an interest rate that we have not seen for a long time.
This is an Italian entity based in Milan and Rome that offers Spanish Raisin users to contract their deposits, whose funds are protected by the Italian FGD.
Just 3 months ago, in April 2022, this entity offered this product at 1.25% APR, which subsequently rose to 1.84% APR and now to 2.09%.
In addition to the 3-year deposit, the entity offers 1 and 2-year deposits, as well as a savings account:
The rest of the characteristics of the deposits are:
Contracting is carried out through the Raisin Electronic Platform.
Most Raisin banks are foreign entities without a bank record in Spain and, therefore, you have additional tasks:
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."
590,ECB raises the interest rate to 0.5%. Mortgages and deposits rising…,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/bce-sube-el-tipo-de-interes-hasta-el-05-hipotecas-y-depositos-subiendo/,22/07/2022,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has suddenly raised the interest rate to 0.5%, double what was expected.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
When we commented in April that the end of free money was approaching due to inflation (see here), we did not expect it to last so long.
Year-on-year inflation in the euro zone stood at 8.6% in June, compared to 8.1% in May. It represents the largest price increase in the entire historical series and more than four times the ECB's price stability goal of 2%.
The Euribor has been rising and rising since December, when it was -0.5%, and the average for the month of July is already close to 1% (0.943%). If it closes like this, it would be the largest registration since July 2012.
People who renew their mortgages now will see that the interest rate on their mortgage has risen by 1.5%, which will mean on average that they have to pay around €1,500 more per family per year.
Difficult times will return...
It is clear that if the Euribor, the interbank interest, rises, many banks will see that it is cheaper to finance themselves through savers.
What has been sold to us for years that banks could not pay interest on our money is over: Positive interest rate, Euribor around 1%...
The free money has now ended, and there is little justification left for ING or BBVA to continue charging for customer deposits. The lies that the banks have sold us in this time no longer hold up.
The deposit market, there are quite a few movements. We hadn't seen anything like this in a long time:
Be careful, many of these deposits are very long term. Our recommendation is not to commit yourself for a long time. Deposits will continue to rise.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised the interest rate by 0.75%, the largest increase in history, to 1.25%.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
Due to inflation, the ECB will stop adding to its balance of debt purchases and will raise the price of money to 0.25% in July and will raise it again in September. It will be the first increase in 1 decade.
Free money ends, and banks will look for liquidity. Will they fight again for our money? Will deposits go up?
Inflation began to pick up in 2021 with the end of the COVID lockdown and a return to more or less normality.
But ever since Russia decided to invade Ukraine, the CPI has spiraled out of control. The latest data is 9.8%.
The Euribor is rising, will it pay for deposits again?"
591,"Updated account comparison: Banco Sabadell, Orange Bank, MyInvestor or Renault Bank?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/comparativa-actualizada-cuentas-mas-rentables-banco-sabadell-orange-bank-myinvestor-o-renault-bank/,21/07/2022,"A little over a week ago we published a comparison of these 4 accounts and it is already obsolete, because 2 of the accounts have updated their conditions (for the better) in this short period of time.
These are the accounts of Orange Bank, MyInvestor, Renault Bank and Banco Sabadell.
Orange Bank (0.5% APR) and MyInvestor (1% APR) have been 2 very profitable accounts for a long time when no one was giving anything for your money.
Recently, Renault Bank and especially Banco Sabadell (1% APR) have entered strongly, offering very interesting returns.
Renault Bank, which had been offering 0.45% APR since June, has increased by 0.1 percentage points, and is now offering 0.55% APR.
MyInvestor raised its remunerated limit to 1% APR from €15,000 to €20,000 and allows its clients to extend this profitability indefinitely after the initial 12 months if they invest at least €300 per month in the entity's investment products. : indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
The 4 accounts give much more than most deposits and with the great advantage of having liquid money, super important at this time when the savings market is on a growing trend.
During the first year of being a customer, the clear winner is Banco Sabadell and its recent offer at 1% APR and for up to a maximum of €30,000.
MyInvestor also offers a 1% APR, but limits it to €20,000 of investment.
Starting in the second year, the standout offer is Renault Bank, which offers its account at 0.55% APR without limits. In addition, it sells a deposit at 1.4% APR (see here).
Orange Bank would lose a position in favor of Renual Tabnk by giving 0.5% APR for an indefinite period and for the newly updated limit of up to €100,000.
MyInvestor would be the most profitable indefinitely as long as you invest €300 in its indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
We see that the most complete (more services) is Orange Bank.
*It is for an indefinite period if you invest €300 per month in indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans.
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
You should take advantage of the MyInvestor and Banco Sabadell promotions. A 1% APR is still an excellent return compared to what is on the market.
As an account, the best is Orange Bank, due to its services and profitability.
We should not rule out Renault Bank either, we do not recommend simply putting the money in the account, but rather taking advantage of its deposit at 1.4% APR, one of the best on the market.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
592,"MyInvestor increases the remuneration up to €20,000 at 1% APR and forever?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/myinvestor-sube-hasta-20-000e-la-remuneracion-al-1-tae-y-para-siempre/,20/07/2022,"MyInvestor has increased the maximum remuneration of their account to 1% APR for new clients from €15,000 to €20,000 for 12 months.
But if you invest at least €300 per month in their indexed portfolios (roboadvisor), funds and plans, you can continue enjoying that 1% APR indefinitely.
With the change now, MyInvestor pays €13.5 net per month for 12 months (€162), €42 more for opening an account and putting €20,000 in it.
If you also invest, you will have those €13.5 “forever”.
The current account characteristics are:
Minors can also open this account and deposit €20,000 and get €13.5 per month in net interest.
To open the account you need:

MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
593,"Comparison of accounts without commissions and without conditions: BBVA, Santander, Sabadell and ING",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/comparativa-cuentas-online-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condiciones-bbva-santander-sabadell-e-ing/,19/07/2022,"First, BBVA, then Santander, then Sabadell and now ING launches an online account without commissions and without conditions. Which is the best? Let's compare them.
These are the 3 banks that charge the most commissions to clients (BBVA, Santander and Sabadell), and the bank that has always been characterized as the commission-free bank (ING).
BBVA always marketed a free account on Uno-e, but since it ceased to exist, BBVA sells it directly. Santander copied it, and then Banco Sabadell, and a few days ago ING.
We already said that it was strange every time one of these banks launched one of these accounts. An account that asks for nothing and gives you everything for free.
ING has always given everything for free and with practically no conditions. But they have launched an account that they say is ""without conditions and without commissions.""
Yes that's how it is. It doesn't ask for anything and gives you the bill without commissions, but with many covered services. Your payroll account continues as always, but now requires compliance with the conditions or payment of €3 monthly commission.
This move by ING is absurd (see here), like when they imposed a commission on their Orange Account if you did not meet conditions (see here).
“Every day ING looks more like the usual banks”, “Stampede of ING customers”… are comments that are read in the chats.
What traditional banking did not achieve with the issue of ATM commissions and its lies about ING, etc., etc. ING is going to achieve it by itself. Let people start speaking badly about them and go to other banks.
The accounts of the usual banks (those that charge for everything): BBVA, Santander and Sabadell, are practically the same and are WITHOUT CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT COMMISSIONS.
The account that is different and leaves a very bad place is ING.
*The opening only allows 1 single holder. If you wish to add a second owner, you must go to a Sabadell office.
The best account on PAPER right now is undoubtedly Sabadell. It gives you a return of 1% APR for 12 months for a maximum of €30,000.
The But is ING, here are its disadvantages of ING compared to the other 3:
Strange, very strange, that in a comparison, we have to put the disadvantages of ING, instead of its advantages. Something change.
Many of you will say. If you have a payroll account, it has many advantages. Yes it's correct. But it has been ING that has launched an account like those of 3 other banks and that is why we compare it.
In fact, we continue to insist that it is stupid for ING to make this move, when the other banks are moving in the opposite direction.
Furthermore, imposing a commission on your Payroll Account of €3 because your clients do not make a monthly transfer to the account of €700 is even more stupid. Yes, they can withdraw the money as soon as they arrive.
You will earn some commissions for those clients who are absent some month. They will get angry and leave. Something is going wrong at ING, and we are deeply saddened.
NOTE: Not only are BBVA, Sabadell or Santander offering NO CONDITIONS AND NO COMMISSIONS. There are many more banks: Orange Bank, Imagin Bank, Evo Banco, MyInvestor…
Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

594,Renault Bank increases the profitability of its Account to beat Orange Bank,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/renault-bank-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-su-cuenta-para-ganar-a-orange-bank/,18/07/2022,"Renault Bank (0.55% APR)  slightly increases the profitability of its account to be ahead of Orange Bank (0.50% APR).
The increase has been 0.1 percentage points, from 0.45% APR, to 0.55% APR.
With this change, Renault Bank becomes the most profitable entity for an indefinite period.
It had been with that 0.45% APR since May, when it made the first increase, from 0.3% APR.
It would still be below the introductory offer in November 2020, which gave 0.65% APR.
The new features are:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
These conditions are valid until August 31, 2022.

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
595,The ING Payroll Account begins to collect €3 in commissions per month,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/la-cuenta-nomina-de-ing-comienza-a-cobrar-comisiones-de-3e-al-mes/,14/07/2022,"ING begins to charge commissions on its Payroll Account from now to new clients and from November to current clients.
The cost will be €3 per month or €36 per year, but not everyone will have to pay it, only those who do not comply with the entity's requirement to have the account.
That requirement is one of the following:
That is, the same as until now. The difference is that those who had the Payroll Account and stopped earning income continued to maintain the account and the bank did not charge them anything. From now on, they will have to put in 3 euros a month.
It is especially important for those who have a free account for making a monthly transfer of €700. The month you forget, the cost will be 3 euros.
The alternative is the NoCuenta Account, but as we have said, it has many shadows (see here).
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
596,ING launches the NoCuenta Account: with many shadows and endless *,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-lanza-la-cuenta-nocuenta-con-muchas-sombras-y-un-sin-fin-de/,14/07/2022,"ING launches its NoCuenta Account and says that it is ""the account that does not ask you for anything"", and immediately adds an *, the first.
Next, it indicates that it is ""without commissions"" and the second *. Thus, up to a total of 10* to detail all its characteristics.
The only thing that improves this account with respect to your Payroll Account is that it does not require you to direct deposit or payroll, or pension, or monthly transfers. But everything else is buts and more buts:
We believe that the account is limited to €30,000, but we don't know how they are going to do it.
Or maybe it's like the Orange Account, if you put in more than €30,000 you have to pay €12 in commission per month?
The reason is that from now on for new clients and as of November 2022 for existing clients, the entity will begin to charge commissions in its Payroll Account, which will be called Star Account.
Yes, commissions. €3 per month or €36 per year, if you DO NOT direct deposit a payroll or recurring income of at least €700 per month.
The NoCuenta Account is for those people who continue to have the Payroll Account, but do not meet the previous condition, obtaining much fewer services.
At the moment, from what we read in the conditions of the Payroll Account, the bank continues to allow monthly transfers of €700 to have the Payroll Account without commissions.
Be careful, don't forget to make the monthly transfer...
These are the basic differences:
In addition to the services offered by both entities: same-day transfers, bizum... free.

This campaign was launched in November 2021 and was initially set to expire on December 31, 2021 and was extended for periods of 3 months.
As a requirement, the bank asks:
This bonus was obtained by the bank after having kicked out thousands of clients with their commissions from the Santander One account that replaced Account 123.
Many left and the bank, in order to stop the bleeding, backed down, and returned to previous conditions. But the damage had already been done and now he has no choice but to offer €100 to regain payroll.
All this has happened in 2021:
The payment of the promotion will be made to the client's account once the direct debit of the payroll or pension has been verified (on the 7th of each month).

The current fees for the Santander One Account are €20 per month, but they will be exempt if one of the following conditions is met:

The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
598,"Most profitable accounts July 2022: Banco Sabadell, Orange Bank, MyInvestor or Renault Bank?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuentas-mas-rentables-julio-2022-banco-sabadell-orange-bank-myinvestor-o-renault-bank/,12/07/2022,"Orange Bank (0.5% APR) and MyInvestor (1% APR) have been 2 very profitable accounts for a long time when no one was giving anything for your money.
Recently, Renault Bank (0.45% APR) and especially Banco Sabadell (1% APR) have entered strongly, offering very interesting returns.
The 4 accounts give much more than most deposits and with the great advantage of having liquid money, super important at this time when the savings market is on a growing trend.
During the first year of being a customer, the clear winner is Banco Sabadell and its recent offer at 1% APR and for up to a maximum of €30,000.
MyInvestor also offers a 1% APR, but limits it to €15,000 of investment.
Starting in the second year, the offer that stands out is Orange Bank, which offers 0.5% APR for an indefinite period and for the newly updated limit of up to €100,000.
Renault Bank offers its account at 0.45% APR without limits, it is the least profitable, but the most interesting thing about this bank is that it offers a deposit at 1.4% APR (see here).
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
We see that the most complete (more services) is Orange Bank.

Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
You should take advantage of the MyInvestor and Banco Sabadell promotions. A 1% APR is still an excellent return compared to what is on the market.
As an account, the best is Orange Bank, due to its services and profitability.
We should not rule out Renault Bank either, we do not recommend simply putting the money in the account, but rather taking advantage of its deposit at 1.4% APR, one of the best on the market.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.

Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.

This offer replaces the €100 offer for opening an account and using your card 1 time. The bank has realized that with the previous campaign it did not retain customers, who could take the €100 and go somewhere else.
To benefit from the current offer, you only have to register between today, July 11, 2022 and July 31, 2022, and deposit up to €30,000 in the account so that it begins to produce interest.
In total, it would be about €300 of interest, which without withholdings would be around €240.

Today the bank has sent via SMS to its clients the relaunch of the SinyCon Plus deposit, NOT Cancelable in advance, with a profitability of up to 1.15% APR.
It offers the same terms as cancelable deposits, but with a much higher profitability: from 0.6% APR to 1.15% APR.
Detailed information about this product is in the private area of ​​the EBN Banco website.
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are the same:
Yesterday we commented on their cancelable deposits, which were not sufficiently profitable, looking at the products of Renault Bank (see here) or Orange Bank (see here).
Today, after the relaunch, EBN remains close in profitability, but not being able to cancel and the bank being able to do so, is not liked at all, but not at all among savers.
EBN is the first bank we have seen that does not allow customers to cancel their deposits, but the bank can do so.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
604,EBN Banco converts all your deposits into YES cancelable: up to 0.7% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-banco-convierte-todos-sus-depositos-en-si-cancelables-hasta-07-tae/,05/07/2022,"The big problem with EBN deposits is that they were not cancelable in advance by clients; however, the bank DID have the power to terminate the contract before expiration.
At the beginning of June, the bank launched 2 deposits with 3 and 6 month terms that did allow early cancellation, although due to its short term, it was not of much interest whether or not it allowed early withdrawal.
The bank, we believe, has realized this, and now allows the rest of its deposits the possibility of using the money before maturity. Of course, you still maintain your right to early cancellation.
Thus, it now has 6 cancelable deposits from 3 to 36 months and with returns from 0.20% APR to 0.70% APR:
*Cancellable in advance by the client.
The rest of the features are:
However, after recent events and seeing how the deposit market is evolving, a 0.7% APR for 3 years already seems too low profitability. Note that Renault Bank already offers a 1.4% APR for its 2-year deposit (see here) or that Orange Bank offers a 0.5% APR up to €100,000 with your liquid money (see here).

On the 27th, the bank decided to raise it to 1.1% APR and it seems that it was not enough and the bank raised it again to 1.4% APR.
The current offer exceeds the initial 1% APR that the entity offered when it launched it in Spain.
Its history has been all cuts, except the last 2 months: In April 2021 it was cut to 0.85% APR, in June 2021 to 0.75% APR, and so on to 0.7% APR.
As a downside, the bank insists on requiring clients to comply fully with the deadline, not allowing early cancellation.
The current account characteristics are:
These conditions are valid until July 14, 2022.
Renault Bank recently increased the profitability of its Savings Account from 0.3% APR to 0.45% APR and applies it to all customers.
Until now, new customers could enjoy an initial period of 2 months at 0.5% APR, which has disappeared, but will reward you more indefinitely.
The entity offered this account at its launch at 0.65% APR, then lowered it to 0.5% until December 1, 2021, when it lowered it to 0.3% APR.
The new features are:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
These conditions are valid until July 14, 2022.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

The current conditions of 0.5% APR and up to €40,000 still appear on their website.
It is yet another movement by banks to hoard liquidity in view of the rise in rates and the rapid rise of the Euribor, in the face of runaway inflation.
On December 1, 2021, Orange Bank reduced the profitability of its account from 1% APR to 0.5% APR, but increased the maximum remuneration from €20,000 to €40,000.
Now that maximum will be raised to €100,000, so a client could get €500 in annual interest from this entity, or €41 per month.
The current features of the account will be starting tomorrow:
Release:



We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

Wizink re-launched this improved offer at the beginning of June for new customers.
Specifically, the Bank asks that you be a new customer, register and make purchases or cash withdrawals with your card for a minimum amount of €300 during the first 3 months from the granting of the card.
We don't think it's that much of a problem to make expenses of €300 in 3 months, and the prize, €100, is worth it.

Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card, as we understand, comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.

Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

This is an Italian entity based in Milan and Rome that offers Spanish Raisin users to contract their deposits, whose funds are protected by the Italian FGD.
Just 2 months ago, in April 2022, this entity offered this product at 1.25% APR. That is, an increase of 0.59 percentage points.
In addition to the 3-year deposit, the entity offers 1 and 2-year deposits, as well as a savings account:
The rest of the characteristics of the deposits are:
Contracting is carried out through the Raisin Electronic Platform.
Most Raisin banks are foreign entities without a bank record in Spain and, therefore, you have additional tasks:


Banco Progetto offers through the Raisin platform the most profitable deposit on the market: 1.25% APR for 3 years.
This is an Italian entity based in Milan and Rome that offers Spanish Raisin users to contract their deposits, whose funds are protected by the Italian FGD."
609,EBN modifies its deposits YES cancelable by clients to the WORSE. They were already bad,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ebn-modifica-a-peor-sus-2-depositos-si-cancelables-por-los-clientes-ya-eran-malos/,24/06/2022,"At the beginning of June, EBN Banco launched 2 deposits that WERE cancelable by customers, the great drawback of their products.
However, we said then that the interest rate was low and the term was too short. These were 2 deposits with a term of 3 and 6 months and with returns of 0.2% and 0.3% APR.
But not even 2 weeks have passed, the bank has decided to cut the profitability of one of them, leaving it as follows:
Do you think it will be received? We doubt it, having offers such as the Renault Bank account at 0.45% APR, Orange Bank at 0.5% APR or MyInvestor at 1% APR (only for 1 year).
To contract this deposit, you must have previously opened a checking account at EBN Banco.
That's how it is. EBN deposits, the most profitable, are not cancelable by clients, and the bank also reserves the right to cancel them if it deems appropriate.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.
These products are:
The rest of the features are:
EBN Banco offers from January 1, 2022 a 0.05% APR on its Remunerated Account with the following characteristics:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

It is one of the best offers we have seen in a long time, because it does not involve any cost to the customer, who simply wins €100.
The conditions are:
The bank will pay the €100 bonus on July 25, 2022 into the Sabadell Online Account.
Yes, the bank pays €100 (net) to the client's account, since Sabadell is responsible for paying another €23.46 to the Treasury as personal income tax withholdings.

Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
611,"Banco Big continues to give 1% for 3 months, somewhat outdated",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-big-sigue-dando-el-1-a-3-meses-algo-desfasado/,21/06/2022,"We already said it about Wizink, and now it is Banco Big's turn, which continues without changing its offer despite the latest events.
Banco Big opened its doors at the end of 2020, with negative interest rates and a perpetual drop in the profitability of deposits.
So it offered that 1% APR for 3 months for new customers which had a certain appeal. But things have changed since then.
Currently the 12-month Euribor (interest rate at which banks lend money) is skyrocketing. The daily value is already above 1%, and several banks are raising their rates or launching new deposits:
In this scenario, the fact that Banco Big intends to attract new clients with only 1% APR for 3 months and now demands to combine it with a fund, seems like a small thing to us, very little, in the case of a bank with still little penetration in the Spanish market.
The features are:
With this product a new client can get €125 gross interest during the 3 months if they deposit €50,000
NOTE: This offer now requires the customer to invest at least €10,000 in an investment fund. Nothing interesting if you were not interested in their funds beforehand.
The rest of their products do not accompany either. The entity currently offers 3 deposits:
It has the same characteristics as the welcome deposit, except that the maximum investment limit is 250,000


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
612,The announced end of ING's Twyp since it integrated Bizum. And the cashbank?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/el-fin-anunciado-de-twyp-de-ing-desde-que-integro-bizum-y-el-cashbank/,20/06/2022,"ING was a pioneer by launching an application to send, receive and share expenses only using the mobile number, back in 2015, but it will close on August 17, 2022.
It has been clearly surpassed by Bizum, a similar platform, but created by the majority of Spanish banks and 1 year after Twyp, in 2016.
Both applications have coexisted throughout this time, but the end of Twyp was clear since the entity itself, ING, under pressure from its clients, allowed them to use Bizum in 2020.
The reception of Bizum by its clients was such that in just 3 months, 400,000 of its clients signed up, which was more than 15% of all ING clients at that time.
Despite the closure of Twyp, ING customers could continue to enjoy this service, because this functionality will be integrated directly into the ING application.
It will therefore be even more convenient for ING customers. The downside, always, is that they force you to make a purchase in these stores, tobacconists and other establishments (30,000):
From a functional point of view, Twyp was better than Bizum, because an application not associated with a bank and allows any customer of any bank to use it.
On the other hand, Bizum is a functionality within the electronic banking of a specific bank, and that allows you to do the same with any other client with Bizum, regardless of the bank to which it belongs.
The problem with Bizum is that you had to be from a bank that was a member. But it is not so much of a problem when 96% of the banks are members.
The difficulties were faced by the clients of a bank outside this platform, such as ING, and who finally had no choice but to accept and join.
If you are a customer of any bank (the majority) and you use their APP, and therefore, you are already a potential Bizum customer. On the other hand, if you want Twyp, you have to find out about its existence and want to download it.
When ING integrated Bizum, there were just over 1 million users with the Twyp application, while Bizum had close to 12 million.

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

613,Only until 6/28 at Renault Bank: deposit at 1.1% APR and account at 0.45% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/solo-hasta-el-28-6-en-renault-bank-deposito-al-11-tae-y-cuenta-al-045-tae/,17/06/2022,"Renault Bank increased the profitability of its products on May 27, but limited it to 1 month, until June 28, 2022.
According to the bank, the reception has been very good among savers and even suggests that they have gone too far by offering so much remuneration.
What will happen when the date arrives? Due to the movements of the other banks, Renault Bank's offer has been the most aggressive, but it has a big but: and that is that its deposit does not allow early cancellation during the entire 2-year period.
Therefore, we would not be able to tell you if the bank will maintain it at the end of the term, extend it or lower the interest rate. Raising it even more we almost ruled it out.
To do? We believe that this is going to go up; and block your money for 2 years… but 1.1% APR is a very good interest rate compared to other entities that do not even reach half of that.
The current offer exceeds the initial 1% APR that the entity offered when it launched it in Spain, it is a considerable increase: from 0.7% APR to 1.1% APR.
Especially if we see his history. Just cuts and cuts: In April 2021 it was cut to 0.85% APR, in June 2021 to 0.75% APR, and so on to 0.7% APR.
The current account characteristics are:
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.
These conditions are valid until June 28, 2022.
Renault Bank increases the profitability of its Savings Account from 0.3% APR to 0.45% APR and applies it to all customers.
Until now, new customers could enjoy an initial period of 2 months at 0.5% APR, which has disappeared, but will reward you more indefinitely.
The entity offered this account at its launch at 0.65% APR, then lowered it to 0.5% until December 1, 2021, when it lowered it to 0.3% APR.
The new features are:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
These conditions are valid until June 28, 2022.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
614,Bankinter extends the 5% APR of its Payroll accounts until December 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bankinter-amplia-hasta-diciembre-de-2022-el-5-tae-de-su-cuenta-nomina-pension-y-no-nomina/,16/06/2022,"Bankinter extends until December 31, 2022 the term for contracting its Payroll and Non-Payroll Account in which they offer a return of 5% APR during the first year, and 2% APR during the second year for the money you deposit in the account. same.
But there is a little trick, as everyone should know by now, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, only the first €5,000 is remunerated (Bk young, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
It is a good offer considering that it is the same (even improved in terms of requirements) as what was offered at least 10 years ago (We published it for the first time in 2012). And since then the landscape of accounts and deposits has changed radically.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
Bankinter offers until June 30, 2022 its friend plan in which it gives €50 to both the godfather and the godson in addition to remunerating your money at 5% APR during the first year and 2% APR during the second year, in exchange for the domiciliation of a payroll.
As a requirement, the bank requires you to sign up for a Payroll Account (domiciliary payroll from €800) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below (enter the email correctly in case the sponsor/godson has to contact you).
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until December 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."

With this plan, the bank aims to attract new clients for its Payroll Account with the help of its already clients.
Offers a €40 bonus to both the new customer (godson) and the existing customer (godfather).
The Dutch entity had been giving €50 for years with the Amigo Plan, but in 2022, it has cut the prize to €40, which after taxes is removed, remains at €32.4.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 400 euros gross.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 in commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.
NOTE: according to bank data, as of February, 14,000 clients have paid commissions (see here)


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120

617,Free money is over. ECB will raise rates. How will it affect deposits?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/se-acabo-el-dinero-gratis-bce-subira-tipos-como-afectara-a-los-depositos/,10/06/2022,"Due to inflation, the ECB will stop adding to its balance of debt purchases and will raise the price of money to 0.25% in July and will raise it again in September. It will be the first increase in 1 decade.
Right now, the interest rate is at 0%. The deposit facility at -0.5%. The marginal credit facility at 0.25%.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, eurozone inflation has run amok. It is expected that in 2022 it will end at 6.8% and in 2023 at 3.5%.
We remind you that the main objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability in the euro zone, thus protecting the value of the euro. The ECB establishes that price growth should not exceed 2% annually for the euro zone as a whole.
With inflation in sight, it must act and the way is to raise the price of money and eliminate liquidity.
The banks are already anticipating these increases seeing the evolution of the Euribor, which is already positive (and those with mortgages, paying more). It is the average price paid by one bank to another for a loan.
That is to say, the free money has now ended, and perhaps from now on, the banks will decide to go and collect money from savers.
From the outset, there will be little justification for ING or BBVA to charge for customer deposits. The lies that the banks have sold us in this time will no longer hold up.
In fact we already see the first signs that they will have to pay for our money. Several banks, since May, have been raising the interest rate on their deposits. There are already 6 that we are aware of:
Be careful, many of these deposits are very long term. Our recommendation is not to commit yourself for a long time. Deposits will continue to rise.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised the interest rate by 0.75%, the largest increase in history, to 1.25%.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has suddenly raised the interest rate to 0.5%, double what was expected.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
Inflation began to pick up in 2021 with the end of the COVID lockdown and a return to more or less normality.
But ever since Russia decided to invade Ukraine, the CPI has spiraled out of control. The latest data is 9.8%.
The Euribor is rising, will it pay for deposits again?"

The summer months do not usually see many movements, but with the current situation, with inflation skyrocketing and the Euribor rising, who knows?

Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.

Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
620,"EBN launches 2 YES deposits that can be canceled by clients, but short term and low interest",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ebn-lanza-2-depositos-si-cancelables-por-los-clientes-pero-corto-plazo-y-bajo-interes/,07/06/2022,"One of the problems with EBN deposits is that they are not cancelable in advance by clients, and perhaps hence the bank's interest in advertising these products exclusively for the entity's clients.
These are 2 deposits with a term of 3 and 6 months that allow early cancellation if the client wishes. The bad thing, the low interest rate, at 0.2% and 0.3% APR.
In the event that the client requests to have the money before maturity, a penalty equivalent to the interest generated is applied. Come on, you get back the money invested and that's it.
The characteristics of this product are:
To contract this deposit, you must have previously opened a checking account at EBN Banco.
>> See product details.
That's how it is. EBN deposits, the most profitable, are not cancelable by clients, and the bank also reserves the right to cancel them if it deems appropriate.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.
These products are:

EBN Banco offers from January 1, 2022 a 0.05% APR on its Remunerated Account with the following characteristics:
EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
621,"Facto Account is back, offering deposits of up to 1.4% APR!!",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/cuenta-facto-esta-de-vuelta-ofrece-depositos-de-hasta-14-tae/,06/06/2022,"Facto Account is back and now offers deposits of up to 1.4% APR. Yes, 1.4% APR, exceeding the profitability of any other entity such as Renault Bank, which gives up to 1.1% APR.
Since March 2021, it had not offered anything interesting, only 0.01% APR for all its products.
The bad thing is that this 1.4% APR is for 5-year terms, and in the short term, the bank continues to offer ridiculous profitability. Thus, at 1 year it gives only 0.25% APR.
The profitability is decent after a period of 3 years. It still seems like too much time for that remuneration:

Days
Facto stopped paying your account since June 28, 2021. It then gave 0.2% APR to clients prior to February 2020.
The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.
Currently it remains unchanged.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."

These are the cases of Pibank, EBN, Deutsche Bank and Renault Bank and now BFS. All in the month of May.
In this case, BFS informed us that since May 30, its deposits have been remunerated up to 0.9% APR, 0.25 percentage points more than until now.
The fixed terms of this entity are as follows:
The characteristics of these products are:
As a novelty, it has launched a growing deposit:
These products have 2 disadvantages:
The entity is a Portuguese entity, it operates in Spain as an ING-style branch, with personal income tax withholdings, but under the Portuguese FGD.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
623,Deutsche Bank continues to offer deposit of up to 0.6% APR in June 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/deutsche-bank-sigue-ofreciendo-deposito-de-hasta-06-tae-en-junio-2022/,01/06/2022,"Deutsche Bank, which launched paid deposits in the month of May after years, continues to offer them during the month of June.
These products are even more profitable than those offered by Pibank or Wizink and even the Orange Bank account.
These are fixed terms to raise liquidity. Is it because there is an upward trend (see here) or is it perhaps because the bank needs liquidity to face its problems? (See here)
Specifically, Deutsche Bank has launched 3 fixed terms called Depósito Solidez DB with the following returns:
The characteristics of these products are:
As we have said, it is for new clients or new money.


Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.

Last time it was initially launched for 1 month and then they extended it for 1 more month. Will he do the same this time? Nobody knows, so if you plan to take advantage of this bonus, do it better beforehand.
With this plan, the bank aims to attract new clients for its Payroll Account with the help of its already clients.
Offers a €40 bonus to both the new customer (godson) and the existing customer (godfather).
The Dutch entity had been giving €50 for years with the Amigo Plan, but in 2022, it has cut the prize to €40, which after taxes is removed, remains at €32.4.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 400 euros gross.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 in commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.
NOTE: according to bank data, as of February, 14,000 clients have paid commissions (see here)


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

How long will it take for this online entity to raise rates while offering Deutsche Bank at 0.6% APR or BFS at 0.65% APR or EBN up to 0.7% APR and even better, Renault Bank at 1.1% APR? ? What do you believe? Leave us a comment below.

It also remodels its Savings Account, which now offers 0.45% APR (previously 0.3% APR) for all customers and indefinitely.
As we say, it exceeds the initial 1% APR that the entity offered when it launched it in Spain, it is a considerable increase: from 0.7% APR to 1.1% APR.
Especially if we see his history. Just cuts and cuts: In April 2021 it was cut to 0.85% APR, in June 2021 to 0.75% APR, and so on to 0.5% APR.
The current characteristics of the account are:
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.
These conditions are valid until June 28, 2022.
RenaultBank increases the profitability of its Savings Account from 0.3% APR to 0.45% APR and applies it to all customers.
Until now, new customers could enjoy an initial period of 2 months at 0.5% APR, which has disappeared, but will reward you more indefinitely.
The entity offered this account at its launch at 0.65% APR, then lowered it to 0.5% until December 1, 2021, when it lowered it to 0.3% APR.
The new features are:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.

Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

627,Sabadell demanding more from its clients and Abanca spends €350 to attract them,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/sabadell-exigiendo-mas-a-sus-clientes-y-abanca-se-gasta-350e-por-captarlos/,26/05/2022,"How many clients would Banco Santander have in its Account 123 and how many did it lose by demanding conditions that were unaffordable for those who left?
How many clients will Banco Sabadell have in its Expansión Account and how many will they lose?
We do not know the numbers of the first, but we do know its consequences. The bank backed down and is now paying for them to come back. Specifically €100 for each payroll.
But there are banks that pay much more, such as Abanca, up to €350 for each payroll. Will the change from Sabadell really be a success? We highly doubt it.
Abanca offers new clients who bring payroll to the entity a €300 bonus.
Furthermore, if you are recommended by a friend who is already a customer of the bank, they also get €50 within the Abanca Amigo Plan program.
What the bank customer has to do is get a code that they must share with their friend, who must enter it in the online Clara Account contracting process and subsequently direct debit their payroll.
In exchange, the bank asks:
After receiving the first payment from the payroll, the entity pays €50 to the client who has recommended his friend and he will receive €300 or €150 depending on his salary.
The ATMs available are Euro 6000, Bankia, Sabadell, Bankinter, Caja de Arquitectos and Caja Ingenieros, except in Galicia, where you can do it as many times as you want at any ABANCA ATM.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

In this way, if you want exclusively the Orange Account, it is not possible, you have to pay the toll of contracting the Payroll Account.
Former clients continue to keep their Orange Accounts, without the bank having asked them to contract the Payroll Account.
Nothing or almost nothing. You just have to enter a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit into the entity and you will have the Payroll Account at no cost.
If you don't have any of the above, nothing happens, you just have to make a monthly transfer of €700 to the account and that's it.
If not having commissions means saving, then yes. As in Openbank or Evo Banco…
But what it means to pay you money for your savings, forget about it, it gives you a paltry 0.01% APR on your balance.
That is, €1 if you put €10,000 in for 1 year.

These are interest rates significantly higher than what the market offers, but of course, it is not a current or a bank deposit, since Grupo Galinea is not a financial entity, but rather an insurance company and, therefore, the Invested money is NOT covered by the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD).
In the email you will read several times what says insured, guaranteed. And yes, it is true, but the security and guarantee is given by the solvency of the insurer, in this case Grupo Galilea.
If it fails, as is the case of a bank, there is the support of the FGD. There is nothing here. Of course, the DGS (General Directorate of Insurance) supervises the solvency of insurers, such as the Bank of Spain (BdE), that of banks.
But neither the BdE guarantees that a bank will not fail, and that is why the FGD exists, nor will the DGS do the same for insurers; but without anything behind.
These are really 2 savings insurance policies. The first is similar to an Account because it has no term and the second is similar to a deposit because it has a maturity (5 years).

Yes, in addition to the higher profitability than deposits, this gain is tax-free if the investment is maintained for at least 5 years and does not exceed the maximum annual contribution limit, marked at 5,000 euros, in that period.
If you do not comply, you will pay the same as the deposits.
As we have said, there is no Fund that guarantees your money like the FGD deposits.
If you need liquidity (in the case of the so-called deposit), you could make a rescue, but you will most likely have penalties.
You could even lose money. You must read the fine print of the insurance.
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."

The curious thing is that Banco Santander ALREADY (months ago) realized that it was a WRONG strategy, and backed down, and is now offering €100 for anyone who wants to return to the bank.
If you join the first 3, the cost is €120 per year.
Currently, if you have those 3 links, you do not have to pay commissions.
The only way to have the account without commissions is to be under 30 years old or have a financing/investment or insurance product. Specifically, you must meet 1 of the following 4 requirements:
The account will have a commission of €40 per year (quarterly settlements: €10) if it meets one of the following 2 requirements:
The account will have a commission of €80 per year (quarterly settlements: €20) if it meets one of the following requirements:
Both ask for financing or investment products to exempt you from commissions.
The payroll, cards, and receipts are not enough for the bank to exempt you from commissions. With that, Santander charged you €120 a year and Sabadell is somewhat cheaper, €80.
Will Sabadell's customers flee like those from Santander did? Will Banco Sabadell recover like Santander did? Leave us a comment below.
What would bother me is that new clients can sign up for their account online without asking them for anything in return (without payroll, without using cards, without receipts) and without charging them commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"
633,BBVA offers new customers 6 months of Netflix or HBO or DAZN or Disney + for free…,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bbva-ofrece-gratis-a-nuevos-clientes-6-meses-de-netflix-hbo-dazn-disney/,17/05/2022,"BBVA offers new customers who register with the entity a refund of the subscription fee for one of the most popular streaming services in Spain.
The promotion is available both in offices and online, but we recommend the second option, so you can sign up for the Online account and the Aqua card at no cost.
The entity will return the fee for the first service charged to the account and up to a maximum of €9.99 per month for 6 months.
If the customer has used the Aqua debit card to subscribe to more than one platform, BBVA will only pay the subscription for the first charge issued and always up to a maximum amount of 9.99 euros per month.
The platforms included in the offer are: Netflix, HBO Max, Disney +, Spotify, DAZN and PlayStation Plus.
This offer will be valid until June 30 at 12:00 p.m.
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, you can hire it, but you will surely be left out of its bonus programs like the one above.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
634,"Deutsche Bank: high defaults and drop in capital, reasons for its new deposits?",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/deutsche-bank-alta-morosidad-y-caida-en-el-capital-motivos-de-sus-nuevos-depositos/,16/05/2022,"According to an article published in merca2, Deutsche Bank Spain is taking on the face of Banco Popular, alluding to its current situation; it is too similar to that of Popular before its sale to Banco Santander.
It indicates that the Dutch subsidiary has 2 serious problems: high delinquency (13%) and the drop in capital, which leads to a low coverage rate (46%).
And he describes it as ""dangerously"", because the data is similar to that of Popular on December 31, 2016, shortly before being intervened.
The bank's balance sheet (Deutsche Bank España) is not good either. In 2019 was the last year that the entity made profits (20.49 million), but in 2020, it made 4.78 million losses and even worse in 2021 (12 million).
When a bank starts to have a problem, the normal thing is to start capturing liquidity for what is coming, the same thing that other banks did in a similar situation.
In this way, we would not be surprised if this is the reason why Deutsche Bank has recently launched its liquidity collection deposits:
The characteristics of these products are:
These products can only be contracted for new clients or if you are already a client, you must bring money from outside the bank, as we indicated, it is to capture liquidity.
With everything we've been through in the last decade. We believe that there should no longer be many distrustful people, who doubt that the FGD will take charge in the event of the entity's bankruptcy.
In one way or another, client deposits (less than €100,000 per person and entity) have never been lost and we believe that, if necessary, it will not happen with Deutsche Bank either.
Another issue is that you say, why am I going to put my money in Deutsche Bank, Orange Bank or Pibank or... it doesn't matter to me and I don't have this risk. Well yes, absolutely right.
What do you think?


Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.
Today we echo an email received that denounced ""what is hidden in the conditions of the current promotion of the Deutsche Bank More DB Account."""
635,Renault Bank increases the profitability of its Tú+ Deposit to 0.7% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-sube-la-rentabilidad-su-deposito-tu-hasta-el-07-tae/,12/05/2022,"Renault Bank has also increased the profitability of its savings products; so our hypothesis (see here) that free money has ended is confirmed with each piece of news.
Specifically, it increases the Deposit You from 0.5% APR to 0.7% APR.
It also improves the Contigo Account for new clients, giving them 0.5% APR during an initial period, but maintains the base profitability of 0.3% APR.
Although still far from the initial 1% APR that the entity offered when it launched it in Spain, it is a considerable increase: from 0.5% APR to 0.7% APR.
Especially if we see his history. Just cuts and cuts: In April 2021 it was cut to 0.85% APR, in June 2021 to 0.75% APR, and so on to 0.5% APR.
In recent days, the bank has increased the remuneration of this product, which is as follows:
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.
These conditions are valid until May 26, 2022.
The bank offers a bonus to new customers, giving them a 0.5% initial APR until July 14, 2021 (2 months).
The base profitability remains at 0.3% APR. It has been at this rate since December 1, 2021, until then it was remunerated at 0.5% APR (and before at 0.65% APR).
The new features are:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
The offer is valid only until May 26, 2022.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

Furthermore, these products are for raising liquidity, so with each movement what we have been indicating is confirmed more and more: the free money thing has ended or is ending (see here)
Specifically, Deutsche Bank has launched 3 fixed terms called Depósito Solidez DB with the following returns:

637,"EBN increases the profitability of its deposits, now up to 0.7% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-sube-la-rentabilidad-de-sus-depositos-ahora-hasta-el-07-tae/,11/05/2022,"The news is not the new 0.7% APR profitability offered by EBN Banco, which is still low, although it is one of the highest; but it goes up.
Is it a change in trend? Is it the end of free money? (see here) With inflation through the roof, and the Euribor already positive, can we be optimistic?
It is the second bank to increase the profitability of its products. The first was Pibank (see here), which doubled the remuneration of its 12-month deposit.
In fact, EBN Banco has been allowing the opening of new deposits in its SinyCon deposits since last March 10. Until then, it only allowed the renewal of products that were expiring.
We believe that it is a good sign for them to return to paying us properly for our money.
The changes made affect the terms of 18, 24 and 36 months with increases of between 0.5% APR and 1.5% APR:
The rest of the features are:
EBN Banco offers from January 1, 2022 a 0.05% APR on its Remunerated Account with the following characteristics:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
638,Do you have the Expansion Account? Here you have 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/tienes-la-cuenta-expansion-aqui-tienes-12-alternativas-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condiciones/,10/05/2022,"In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a good deal: comply with the new conditions or pay commissions.
Specifically, the majority of these clients who meet the current commission-free conditions, if they do nothing, will have to pay €20 commission each quarter or €80 per year.
In the worst case, if you do not meet any of the new conditions, the cost of the account will be €240 per year. Still a real robbery.
The solution is easy and the most damage is done to the bank is to request the cancellation of the account or better yet, make a portability to another entity (see here): You go to the bank where you want to go, tell them everything you want to contract and bring and they take care of everything.
There are many entities that continue to offer everything for free without asking for anything in return, which are the ones we are going to talk about here. If you want to join, there are banks that give you up to €350 (read here).
Without further ado, we leave you the list of all these banks:
It offers everything for free in exchange for nothing (account, transfers, card, all ATMs 3 times a month), and is one of the few that offers free immediate transfers and also free Bizum.
In addition, it remunerates your money very well, at 0.5% APR for the first €40,000.
The buts:
Perhaps with these buts, many would remove it from this list and we would agree with them, but that 1% APR...
Give everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers, and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It does not have immediate transfers, but it does have transfers on the day (before 12:00)
In addition, your money is remunerated at 1% APR for the first €15,000, yes, now only for the first 12 months. Then at 0.1% APR.
This entity, paradoxically part of the Santander group, offers its checking account with everything free (account, debit card, normal transfers, Bizum, and all Banco Santander ATMs can withdraw money) in exchange for nothing.
It is one of the few entities that allows you to go to an office (Santander) to withdraw cash (in addition to Santander ATMs) at no cost.
And if you have a payroll, it offers you a greater bonus:
The entity offers a savings account that pays up to 0.05% APR (with payroll) or, if not, at a ridiculous interest of 0.01% APR.
A few months ago he made his account free for everyone, without any requirements (see here)
Its great advantages, in addition to no commissions and no ties, are:
The downside is that it has very few offices (but there are more than practically the rest of the banks that, even if they have offices, do not allow you to go unless you pay).
This is another entity that gives you everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It also has the friend plan in which you can take up to €150 depending on the links you contract.
CaixaBank's online bank (yes, CaixaBank), without commissions and without ties.
It offers the typical: account, cards, transfers and free bizum.
It seems unbelievable, but yes, BBVA has an account without commissions and without ties. It is the Online Account.
Of course, it is only for new customers. We former clients know that they have been able to contract it, but they have to pay for the cards.
Again, it's incredible, but yes, Santander, they also have a commission-free account with no ties. It is the Online Account.
Of course, it is only for new customers.
…and yes, Banco Sabadell itself offers an Online account without commissions and without conditions.
Like the previous 2 cases, the downside is that the entity's current clients cannot hire it. It is only for new customers.
It is the most recommended entity and generates great trust among its clients. It also offers its Payroll Account for people who do not have a payroll. In exchange, it requires monthly income of at least €700 from another entity.
You will have an account, card and normal transfers at no cost, and you will be able to withdraw cash at a wide range of ATMs and even stores with your Twyp APP.
Additionally, if you have a payroll, the entity usually has the Amigo Plan, in which it gives you €50 (currently not in force).
It has the Orange account which is remunerated, but even more ridiculous than Openbank, at 0.01% APR.
We said about OrangeBank that it had the but of the FGD, here we would say the same: it is Dutch (we repeat, for many it is not a but but rather an advantage).
BE CAREFUL that ING recently requires a condition or will charge a commission on your Orange account if you do not have a payroll account (see here).
Bankinter also offers you an account without commissions, and without the need for payroll, but requires links:
And if you have a payroll, much easier:
The prize is not bad at all. Plus everything free. It pays you well during the first 2 years and for a maximum of €5,000
In total there are €350 of interest that the account can generate.
If you want an account without fees, cards, transfers and withdraw cash at any ATM in the world for free, you have to direct deposit a payroll or pension into Pibank.
If you don't do it, you will only have a paid account, although quite well paid, at 0.2% APR.
Accounts proposed by our readers that we add here because they are also interesting:
Abanca Clara Account: No demands and with everything free, included, transfers and Bizum. In addition, the friend plan and €300 welcome bonus are in force (see here).
Cajamar Wefferente Account: No demands and no commissions and as a great advantage you can withdraw cash from €50 for free at any ATM.
N26 Account: It has a Spanish Iban that does not charge you for anything and does not ask you for anything.


Activo Bank has gone for years without any major news, and now it is because it seems that it is reaching the end of its life.
The entity reports on its website that its Active Account ""cannot be contracted temporarily."" Searching more online, the entity plans to migrate these clients to Banco Sabadell, in a new online account, in the style of BBVA or Banco Santander.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because he wants to or because he is too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:
Banks are increasingly demanding more from their clients to exempt them from commissions. It's a competition to see who will charge the most (up to €240, see here).
Some (Santander) have already realized that this is not viable and have made some changes to their Account 123 and launched an Online Account without commissions and without links in the style of the BBVA Online account"
639,New commissions: Expansión Account Clients will pay €20 quarterly starting in June,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/nuevas-comisiones-clientes-de-cuenta-expansion-banco-sabadell-pagaran-20e-trimestrales-a-partir-de-junio/,09/05/2022,"The Expansion Account will be called Sabadell Account as of June 24, 2022 and its clients will have a difficult time if they do not want to pay commissions.
The entity is communicating to its clients via digital email from its electronic banking the changes in conditions/commissions that will come into effect from the aforementioned date.
Most current clients will be charged a commission of €20 per quarter because some of the commission bonuses from the Expansion Account coincide with the new Sabadell Account.
The new Sabadell Account will have quarterly fees of €60 (€240 per year) if you do not have a connection with the bank.
The only way to have the account without commissions is to be under 30 years old or have a financing/investment or insurance product. Specifically, you must meet 1 of the following 4 requirements:
The account will have a commission of €40 per year (quarterly settlements: €10) if it meets one of the following 2 requirements:
The account will have a commission of €80 per year (quarterly settlements: €20) if it meets one of the following requirements:
It is a change similar to the one that Banco Santander made with its Account 123 and it did not last a few months to reverse it. Now he is offering €100 to those who want to return their payroll to the entity (see here).


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

Offers a €40 bonus to both the new customer (godson) and the existing customer (godfather).
This is the entity's second campaign to capture payrolls during 2022. The previous time lasted 2 months: January and February.
This time, the entity sets the end date as May 31 (just like in January), will it be extended by 1 more month like in February?
The Dutch entity had been giving €50 for years with the Amigo Plan, but in 2022, it has cut the prize to €40, which after taxes is removed, remains at €32.4.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 400 euros gross.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
As we have said, the promotion ends today, February 31, 2022, unless it is extended.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 in commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.
NOTE: according to bank data, as of February, 14,000 clients have paid commissions (see here)


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

This offer has its limitations: it is only for new customers, the 5% APR return is only for 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000.
That is, a total bonus of €125 gross or, in other words, just over €100 net, in exchange requires:
The profitability of the savings account after the promotional period will depend on whether you continue to domiciliate your payroll:
The account is commission-free:
In addition, the Payroll Account offers a 0.5% bonus on direct debit bills for electricity, gas, telephone, mobile and Internet.
All of these accounts are non-permanent, so if you want to take your payroll once the first 6 bonus months have passed, you can do so.

The bank with the most fans is Banco Mediolanum with 54.4% of its clients who declare themselves admirers of the entity.
It is even more surprising that it is a world ahead of the second, ING, with only 28.9% of its clients and closely followed by Bankinter, 23.7%.
ING is also the second entity with the fewest angry customers, 3.5%, with Triodos Bank being the leader with only 2.9% of customers.
We are also surprised that neither Banco Santander nor BBVA is on the opposite side.
The bank with the fewest fans is Unicaja, with only 7.1% of customers and more dissatisfied customers: 32.4%.
It is followed by CaixaBank, which has 27.4% angry customers and 13.4% admirers.
Banco Santander is in the top 3 entities with the most angry customers, although in the ranking of fans, it is a little higher.

The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

Bank clients can get a code that they can share with their friends so that they can enter it in the process of contracting their Clara Account online and subsequently direct debit their payroll.
In exchange, the bank asks:
After receiving the first payment from the payroll, the entity pays €50 to the client who has recommended his friend and he will receive €300 or €150 depending on his salary.
The ATMs available are Euro 6000, Bankia, Sabadell, Bankinter, Caja de Arquitectos and Caja Ingenieros, except in Galicia, where you can do it as many times as you want at any ABANCA ATM.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."

647,How Bitcoin is different from mobile money,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/como-se-diferencia-bitcoin-del-dinero-movil/,25/04/2022,"Bitcoin is an electronic currency that serves as a payment method and store of value. It allows users to transfer and receive money across international borders electronically. Unlike fiat money, the existence and use of Bitcoin occurs in the digital space. On the other hand, mobile money refers to a wide range of electronic payment methods made through mobile devices.
Like Bitcoin, mobile money platforms offer various value-added services, including virtual payment for goods and services. However, Bitcoin and mobile money have deep disparities. This is how Bitcoin differs from mobile money.
While Bitcoin and mobile money exhibit some similarities, they serve unique applications. Bitcoin is a currency accepted as payment for goods and services by merchants around the world. Businesses and individuals can also use Bitcoin to trade and invest on stock markets and cryptocurrency exchange platforms, such as immediatebitcoin.app.
Unlike Bitcoin, mobile money is a service that facilitates electronic financial transactions in fiat currencies. Mobile money users must have local currencies to transact, but Bitcoin does not require users to exchange their funds into fiat currencies. They only send the stipulated amount of Bitcoin tokens worth the necessary goods and services.
Bitcoin offers its users the option to create an online or offline wallet, while mobile money has no such provisions. Limited storage options in mobile money services make customers more vulnerable to theft and other cyber threats.
Mobile money transactions are carried out through centralized systems, allowing users to reverse and cancel payments at their convenience. However, Bitcoin transactions are decentralized and irreversible. The Bitcoin blockchain compiles all transactions into an immutable digitized ledger, accessible to all users.
Several mobile money service providers are financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies and money processors. Therefore, all transactions are subject to government regulations and institutional influences. Service providers regulate their customers' transaction volumes and could even refuse payments indefinitely.
On the other hand, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that is not subject to government or regulatory influences. No central authority regulates Bitcoin transactions, allowing users to transact worldwide without outside interference. This ensures greater convenience in sending and receiving payments across international borders.
Various governments and regulatory authorities stipulate that mobile money service providers must partner with third parties to complete cross-border transactions. That usually affects substantial transaction costs and delays in processing large sums of money.
Bitcoin transactions occur on the blockchain without any third party. This offers users the autonomy to manage their assets as they see fit. Additionally, the absence of middlemen also contributes to faster payment processing and low-cost transaction fees. It also protects against fraud and other common risks, such as data theft.
Mobile money users must reveal their identities to service providers to transact, but Bitcoin allows people to transact anonymously.
Transaction costs are the main factors that most people consider when choosing Bitcoin and mobile money. Receiving funds through Bitcoin or mobile money services is free. Sending payments attracts minimal fees, but fees vary significantly.
Mobile money providers set standard fees for remittances based on government regulations, company policies, and transaction volume. Sometimes, service providers may even increase transaction fees indefinitely, causing a substantial financial burden on customers.
Bitcoin has relatively lower transaction costs, determined primarily by transaction volumes. Additionally, Bitcoin payments do not involve intermediaries like mobile money remittances, which impacts low-cost transaction fees. Low transaction costs make Bitcoin appear to be a more efficient payment method than mobile money.
Bitcoin and mobile money are new inventions with several similarities, but they also possess many unique characteristics. The above article has discussed some critical disparities to help you make informed decisions.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.

648,BFS deposits up to 0.65% APR also in April 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/depositos-de-bfs-hasta-065-tae-tambien-en-abril-de-2022/,21/04/2022,"BFS deposits continue to be among the most profitable on the market, giving up to 0.65% APR also during the month of April 2022.
The but is that it requires large investments. To offer you this profitability you have to invest at least €50,000, an amount that not all savers have.
If you have at least €25,000, the bank also gives you the option of investing in its deposits, but the interest rate will be 0.1 percentage points less.
Its profitability is surpassed by few banks, such as MyInvestor, which offer a 1% APR on their savings accounts with limitations (see here):
The characteristics of these products are:
These products have 2 disadvantages:
The entity is a Portuguese entity, it operates in Spain as a branch in the style of ING, with personal income tax withholdings but under the Portuguese FGD.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
649,Orange Bank still requires being an Orange customer to give you the 0.5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-sigue-exigiendo-ser-cliente-de-orange-para-darte-el-05-tae/,20/04/2022,"In the end it was a disappointment. The announcement by the General Director of Orange Bank has not been fulfilled: he assured that before the end of 2021, the account could be contracted by all clients without needing to have an Orange line.
We are already in April 2022 and the bank continues to say that it is only available for customers with an Orange mobile line.
It is the entry toll that you have to pay, since it requires, to get the account at 0.5% APR and everything for free: having a prepaid mobile line or an Orange contract.
But we have already said many times, the Orange mobile line is necessary only in the registration process. Once you are a customer, you can remove yourself as an Orange customer.
In this sense, the ""we help you"" team at Orange Bank has spoken: ""the entity requires that you be an Orange customer to register, but if you later change companies you can continue being an Orange Bank customer, with the only drawback being that you would not be able to benefit from future promotions for Orange customers.
Thus, you can become a customer at no cost and without ties to Orange in the following way:
Once you finish the 3 steps, you can do what you want with the Orange card:
Logically, the most interesting option is the second. There is no cost, you don't have to do anything, and if a promotion comes up...
But in short, you can be Orange Bank customers, without being an Orange customer; although during the process you had to be (1 week at most).
At the end of the year, all this nonsense will no longer be necessary. Of course, its connection with Orange will never disappear, and will always be the burden of this bank, because Orange is not very liked by a significant part of its former clients.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
650,"Banco Pichincha, like Pibank, also increases its deposit to 0.5% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-pichincha-al-igual-que-pibank-tambien-sube-su-deposito-al-05-tae/,19/04/2022,"Banco Pichincha, like its Pibank online branch, increases the profitability of its 1-year deposit to 0.5% APR.

The characteristics of the paid Account are:


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"

The 1% APR return lasts only for 12 months from the date of contract and is exclusively for the first €15,000.

The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

654,Is the Uranian War the beginning of the end of free money? Will deposits go up?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/la-guerra-de-urania-es-el-principio-del-fin-del-dinero-gratis-subiran-los-depositos/,07/04/2022,"Inflation began to pick up in 2021 with the end of the COVID lockdown and a return to more or less normality.
But ever since Russia decided to invade Ukraine, the CPI has spiraled out of control. The latest data is 9.8%.
It is true that the data for our country is very bad, compared to countries like Germany (7.6%), France (5.1%), Italy (7.0%) or Portugal (5.5%), but The truth is that it is not much above the Euro zone average.
Therefore, the ECB must act. Let us remember that its primary objective is the maintenance of price stability in the euro zone.
That is, controlling inflation, thus protecting the value of the euro. The ECB establishes that price growth should not exceed 2% annually for the euro zone as a whole.
At its meeting at the beginning of March, it kept interest rates at 0%, and did not touch bank deposit rates or the liquidity available to banks.
However, it is going to accelerate the withdrawal of stimuli that it has been injecting for years – multiplied during the pandemic – into its debt programs.
The banks already estimate that the Euribor will end 2022 positive and everything indicates that the free money will end.
So: will banks pay decent interest on our money again? How will they now justify continuing to charge for customer deposits like ING or BBVA does?
We are sure that those who have a mortgage will suffer and their payments will begin to go up and up. Those who are renewing in recent months are already noticing it.
But it is not so clear that banks will begin to pay for our money like they did years ago. However, your arguments about charging for deposits will no longer hold water:
Let's hope they pay the deposits again. Our money with this inflation is losing value day after day.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised the interest rate by 0.75%, the largest increase in history, to 1.25%.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has suddenly raised the interest rate to 0.5%, double what was expected.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
Due to inflation, the ECB will stop adding to its balance of debt purchases and will raise the price of money to 0.25% in July and will raise it again in September. It will be the first increase in 1 decade.
Free money ends, and banks will look for liquidity. Will they fight again for our money? Will deposits go up?"

These instant transfers did not last even 1 year (since August 2018) and were eliminated, we believe, by Bankinter when it bought Evo in June 2019.
So, we published a news item indicating this and criticized Bankinter because it had withdrawn this service without prior notice.
After the criticism, the Consultant from the Technology Department of Evo Banco contacted us, telling us that it will be ""ONLY temporarily out of service due to some technical adjustments and that in the coming days it will be reestablished as normal.""
That, as we say, was almost 3 years ago. The last thing we have learned from this same person (September 2019) is that ""the reactivation of the free immediate transfer service has been delayed more than initially planned"" and that they are ""working on a new computer development to be able to restore full operation"" .
Too much time has passed for us to believe it and everything looks very bad, and it seems like they want to make this covert service disappear without telling anyone.
The bank, as soon as it removed immediate transfers, launched the same-day transfer service, similar to that of ING (since 2015) or Self Bank (since 2017).
With this service, the money can arrive at its destination on the same day you make the transfer, the question is the time you request it:
The curious thing about the case is that on the Evo Banco transfers page it indicates in the notes that it has a ""New immediate SEPA transfer service.""
It indicates that «We offer you the new SEPA IMMEDIATE transfer service, we will find the fastest way for your transfer to reach its destination in seconds, at any time of the day and every day of the year as long as it is an amount of up to €100,000, completely secure, immediate and free of charge.

The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.

This is how the entity is communicating to its clients, although the change is small, given ING's limited network, in addition to the extensive ATM networks that the entity already allows to withdraw cash, at no cost and without limits.
In total there are just over 18,000 national ATMs where you can withdraw money at no cost, with no minimums and as many times as you want.
These ATMs are those of:

But you can also do it at any other ATM, as long as you withdraw at least €200 or more. In this case, Evo will assume the commission charged by the entity that owns the ATM up to a maximum of €2, which is the majority.
If an ATM charges more than €2, you have to pay it. So you must pay attention to the information on the cashier's screen.
There it will tell you if you have to pay something, if so, you can cancel the operation and go to another ATM.
For globetrotters, the EVO card allows you to withdraw debit cards at any ATM in the world at no cost. Of course, it is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee that you would have to pay.
Evo Banco eliminated any requirement or condition to have your smart account without commissions, like that basic payment account, but with many more services:
It will be an account with everything free without asking for anything in return.
His conditions were not that demanding, but he had conditions. One of the following had to be met to enjoy its benefits:

As a requirement, the bank asks:

Many left and the bank, in order to stop the bleeding, backed down, and returned to previous conditions. But the damage had already been done and now he has no choice but to offer €100 to regain payroll.

If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.

This law came into force in July 2021 and the ECB warns that it causes an ""adverse and undesirable"" impact on the legal tender status of Euro banknotes.
It is not the first time that Europe sees a Spanish law such as the model 720 sanctions as ""disproportionate"" and that the Government has had to change (see here).
Additionally, the ECB points out that limiting the payment of non-residents to 10,000 euros is discriminatory.
Furthermore, he sees fines of 25% of the amount paid as ""excessive"", and that ""member states must ensure that the measures adopted comply with the principle of proportionality.""
It points out that the Government has not provided clear evidence that establishing this limit will achieve the intended goal and has not even indicated whether other alternative measures could be adopted with a less adverse impact.
Furthermore, the measure is much more restrictive than that set by the European Parliament on the prevention of money laundering or financing of terrorism, which sets a cash payment limit at Union level of 10,000 euros.
The ""use of cash is legitimate"" and is ""especially important for certain groups in society,"" recalls the ECB, emphasizing that ""they facilitate the inclusion of the entire population in the economy"" and are a fundamental payment method for older people. , immigrants, the disabled, and anyone with limited access to digital services.
The use of more than €1,000 in cash is limited for payment in which one of the parties, a company or professional, intervenes.
Only payments between individuals or between individuals and financial institutions will continue without limits.
The sanction will consist of a fine of 25% of the amount paid in cash. Both the payer and the person receiving the payment are jointly and severally liable for the infringement.
The party who reports the transaction within 3 months from the date of payment is exonerated from liability.
The simultaneous presentation of a complaint by both parties will not exonerate any of them from liability.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised the interest rate by 0.75%, the largest increase in history, to 1.25%.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has suddenly raised the interest rate to 0.5%, double what was expected.
It will directly impact mortgage holders, because the Euribor has not stopped rising and of course; and also about savers who are already seeing how every week there are better offers on accounts or deposits.
Due to inflation, the ECB will stop adding to its balance of debt purchases and will raise the price of money to 0.25% in July and will raise it again in September. It will be the first increase in 1 decade.
Free money ends, and banks will look for liquidity. Will they fight again for our money? Will deposits go up?"

It offers up to 0.65% APR, but for large investors.
To offer you this profitability you have to invest at least €50,000, an amount that not all savers have.
If you have at least €25,000 or more, the bank also gives you the option of investing in its deposits, but the interest rate will be 0.1 percentage points less.
Its profitability is surpassed by few banks, such as MyInvestor, which offer a 1% APR on their savings accounts with limitations (see here):
The characteristics of these products are:
These products have 2 disadvantages:
The entity is of Portuguese origin, but for the moment it continues to appear on the list of the Spanish FGD. The bank announced its merger with its Portuguese parent company (Portuguese FGD), but we do not yet have confirmation from the bank if it has taken place.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.

After what happened years ago, when the entity withdrew its classic website and there were ""widespread complaints"", we all fear a new change (see here).
According to ING, “it knows that the simpler we make things, the more freedom you have to do what you want. For this reason, we launched a new design and a new space so that having everything at hand is much easier for you.

Our first experience with the website did not seem very different to us from the previous one, and the changes have not been as radical as the transition from the classic website to the new website, but what do you think?
We have already received some opinions about the new website:
«They already changed it years ago and it got much worse, you commented on the issue here. Now they have changed it again and it is even worse.”
Leave us a comment below.
The usual ING website since it was launched in Spain operated until July 2018. Of course, the entity officially closed that website on July 22, 2016.
During those 2 years, it was possible to continue ""enjoying"" the classic website through a method that we discovered and then shared with the followers of that website.
The entity then justified the elimination of the classic website because it was inefficient to maintain the 2 websites.
The new website has lasted 6 years and is now replaced by a new version now available.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

When looking for the best digital wallet, you have to take care of so many things that it is not an easy task for the new investor. At first, the options were fewer, but safe; Now, the options are many in number, but they are not certain. It is challenging to find the best digital wallet to secure digital currency. You will have to do a lot of research and after that there is no guarantee that the platform is safe, so you should always take your time and then make a decision. It is one of the most important parts of investing in this digital currency because if you do not have the best high-quality digital wallet, your account can be hacked easily.
That is why one should never be negligent in selecting the digital wallet and put in a lot of effort while doing research. If you think that your cryptocurrency is safe enough on the exchange platform, you are wrong. It will not provide security; Instead of security, you will invite hackers to target your account and steal your digital coins.

Things to consider about the digital wallet
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.
Maybe you're wondering how blockchain technology could revolutionize supply chains? Here's how this technology could help revolutionize supply chains.

663,Bitcoin Wallet: Essentials to Secure Your Digital Wallet,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/billetera-bitcoin-aspectos-esenciales-para-asegurar-su-billetera-digital/,28/03/2022,"Digital wallet is one of the essential things required to protect your digital currencies, but you must also protect your digital wallet. Because if there is no security in the digital wallet, how can you make sure your bitcoins are safe enough? One should always keep in mind that their digital wallets should be reputable and there should also be good working experience of the company. The security of the digital wallet should never be neglected. If someone does this, they will have to bear a significant loss and will ruin their investment in no time. That is why the new investor must follow proper precautions and avoid hackers. If you are interested in bitcoin trading, check how many Spanish users are into bitcoin.
There is no other option to avoid hackers, and always keep in mind that the security of the wallet is in your hand. Nobody else can do anything. Several scams have been carried out due to lack of digital wallet security in recent years. If you do not follow all the rules, you will have to face poor results and loss of funds. But if you properly secure your digital wallet, it will protect your coins well.
Phone security must be high
If you use the mobile version-based digital wallet, your phone's security lock feature must be enabled with a high-level password so that hackers cannot open your device. Setting a password on your smartphone and tablet will enable the extra layer of security of the digital wallet and always keep the password strong enough and unguessable. When thieves steal your device, it will be difficult to open the phone.
Many owners do not take this simple and essential step, but it is necessary to enable a high-level password on your lock screen. According to a report, 36 percent of people use a four-digit PIN code for their phone security. It is good to always be prepared for future risks and, for mobile security, a very advanced password should be used. Please don't use password like date of birth and years, because everyone can easily crack that password.
Be careful of your surroundings
Sometimes you visit a coffee shop or any place, and you have to avoid the neighbors and never answer their emails and anything else related to Bitcoin. The reason is that they are watching all your activities and also behave as if they are not watching you. One should never give your mobile device to anyone because it can be quite risky. After all, your email doesn't have passwords, right? They can quickly review all emails and messages.
If you respond to their emails and other activities, they will see everything, and the habit of disseminating data to everyone is the most important thing. If somehow your data and email falls into the wrong hand, then it can affect your digital currencies and wallet. Therefore, it is much better to avoid them and keep your phone away from them.
Don't use the same password all the time
If you want to avoid hackers targeting your digital wallet, you should never use the same password again because it helps them guess. It is very inconvenient to use the same password everywhere and avoid the risk of hackers. One should keep rotating the password every day. It will help you protect your account and the hacker will not guess the password. From the data, many investors use the same password on each digital wallet account, and most people are attacked by the hacker. So if you want to avoid them, there is no better way than this. Don't keep your password easy to guess, such as birth dates; Your primary mobile device should always use a strong, unbreakable password.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.

Less than 1 week to present model 720,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/dinero-en-bancos-extranjeros-menos-de-1-semana-para-presentar-modelo-720/,25/03/2022,"There is less than 1 week left (until March 31) to submit form 720, the declaration of assets abroad, if you have had money in foreign banks in 2021 or you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency.
This is so, despite the fact that on January 27, 2022, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared the obligation to present form 720 illegal, considering that the sanctions and fines are ""disproportionate"" and undermine the free movement of capital in the European Union.
It was clear that the Government was going to react and just 1 month later, the Congress of Deputies approved the new sanctioning regime of model 720 of the Tax Agency for the declaration of assets abroad, to avoid the illegality declared by the CJEU.
The sanctions have been reduced, but you will continue to be sanctioned, because:
Taxpayers who own any of the following groups of assets abroad that exceed a total of more than 50,000 euros will be required to submit this informative return:
In short, if the total of each of the 3 previous groups of assets does not exceed 50,000 euros, you are not required to present form 720.
Once Form 720 is presented for the first time, in subsequent years, it will only be mandatory when any of the joint balances of the three different blocks of assets mentioned above have experienced an increase of more than 20,000 euros compared to those that determined the presentation of the last statement.
If you had a lot of money abroad, you would also have to declare it in the Bank of Spain, which requires according to Circular 4/2012, of April 25, which came into force on January 1, 2014:

BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
Novum Bank, an entity from Malta, and WITHOUT a branch in Spain, offers a deposit at a high interest, 2.5% APR, and a one-year term.
It would be similar to Wizink, Facto or EBN, but much shorter term. The bad thing is that the money would be abroad and what it entails."

This time, as has been the case for some time, these deposits are NOT cancelable by the client, but the bank has the power to modify the conditions or even cancel them early. Is it legal?
The profitability of these deposits has been decreasing over time, like the rest of the banks; However, they are still fairly decent, always comparing with what other banks offer.
The characteristics of these deposits are:
The issue of the deposit not being cancelable by clients is something that they do not like, but also that it does allow the bank to cancel it already makes one's teeth grind.
EBN establishes this clause in the “Other information” point of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract (see page 8).
It is a condition to protect against future changes in strategy or even variation in the interest rate. Is it legal?

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

Do they really offer money in exchange for a simple payroll direct debit? Yes, but like mobile or internet companies, they require a permanence and something more.
The Bank of Spain warned about this (see here), although we have always reminded you that you must read the fine print and accept its conditions.

Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you the €350 directly, but that they reward you all that money for leaving only €5,000 in the account for 2 years is difficult to find these days.

Cajamar gives €200 in cash if you direct a new payroll to the entity for the first time of at least €1,200 (If it were less, but greater than €950, it would give you €100).
Additionally, it requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.

Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become a customer, the bank used to continue offering you new promotions.
It's the stupidest case. How many clients did you attract with your Account 123? And how many clients did you lose with your Santander One?
You spend a lot of money to attract payroll, and you lose it because of a stupid decision and now you have to spend more money again to attract clients, but what we don't know (or we do) is that if people will want to return.
The bank's current offer is that it gives €100 (gross) if the client:
The payment of the promotion will be made to the client's account once the direct debit of the payroll or pension has been verified (on the 7th of each month).
The promotion will be valid until March 31, 2022.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
668,"14,000 ING clients have paid commissions for having excess balances",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/14-000-clientes-de-ing-han-pagado-comisiones-por-tener-exceso-de-saldo/,16/03/2022,"ING, since April 1, 2021, charges commissions to its clients who do not have a payroll account and deposit more than €30,000 in the entity.
According to data from the entity, as of February 2022, almost 1 year after said policy, only 14,000 clients have paid commissions.
This is because their clients have adapted to the new policy, contracting the Payroll Account or withdrawing cash from the bank to other entities.
In this sense, in 2021, ING has accelerated the acquisition of clients in the payroll account, with the entry of 307,000 new clients and now totals 4.2 million.
Yes, commissions at ING are a reality, if you do not meet certain conditions as we have indicated. It is something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
Non-compliant parties must pay €10 per month, but you can avoid it by fulfilling one of the following two conditions:
The Orange Account will continue without commissions, without limits and is remunerated at 0.01% APR:
The bank does not allow you to have €30,000 or more in the Orange account if you do not have the payroll account and meet the conditions.
If you have less, there are no commissions, nor does it require you to have a payroll account, but the Orange Account is not remunerated (0% APR).
We know that complying with ING's new conditions is very easy to follow commissions, but the cost of losing what you have earned (and paid) so much for so many years (ad after ad) was truly so high.
It is a stupid decision by the bank, because all of us who know ING associate it with NO COMMISSIONS, which has been lost.
And it also only affected 171,000 clients, 4%, of which they have adapted and finally only 14,000 clients are paying commissions (and it seems like a lot to us).
To charge only 14,000 clients, the bank has lost that immaculate NO COMMISSION status.
The entity, of course, avoids the ""unusual economic moment in which interest rates (which set the price of money) are falling relentlessly,"" having been ""negative for years.""
This situation, says the bank, ""forces it to make some changes to our ORANGE Account.""
For more information, INRI says that ING was born ""as a savings bank"" and that is why it has always ""bet on giving your savings the highest profitability that the market allowed us"", which due to the ""negative rates forces us to take this measure."" ».
>> See Bank statement
The only true thing he has said is that it was born as a bank for your savings, but it stopped being that way a long time ago, and we have been saying it for a long time.
We have also said that negative rates do not mean that they do not have to remunerate our money. In fact, you can see entities on the market that offer good profitability in a savings account like ING's:
Furthermore, that does not explain the reason for charging €10 per month or €120 per year for having more than €30,000 in the bank.
Where do you get that cost from? Could it be that they want to profit? Or simply coerce your clients to sign up for the payroll account?
It is true that if the bank puts all the clients' money in the ECB it costs them more than €120 per year per client with more than €30,000 (-0.5% annually), but as we have already said more than once; nor is it mandatory to do that, if in fact no bank does it.
They only deposit a small part (they currently deposit 5% in the ECB), which will indeed have a cost, but it cannot even remotely reach €120 per client. I recommend you read: the lies of the banks to justify the possible charge for deposits.
We did not believe that ING was going to do what the big banks like Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank or Bankia say. The truth is that every day he looks more like them.
We reiterate: how we miss the ING of a few years ago….


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

People who prefer to stay in front of their mobile phone or computer screen rather than go for a walk with friends or play sports. Most people think that spending hours and hours immersed in the world of gaming or in a roulette casino has no health benefits, quite the opposite. But is that really true? In this article we show you some benefits of online games for your health.
These types of online games require players to concentrate much more than is necessary to carry out other types of daily tasks. Each level is a different challenge, and if you want to overcome them all without being eliminated first, you must develop an almost perfect attention span. That is why gaming constantly “forces” you to avoid distractions.
Saving the distance, online games could be compared to meditation. The purpose of meditating is to be in the here and now, avoiding all the mental noise that takes us away from the present. In short, be much more aware and develop a great capacity for attention. Just the same thing that gaming helps you with.
As said before, each game has different levels or tests that the user must overcome. Every level is harder that the previous one. Therefore, the player must improve himself a little more each time if he really wants to go to the end and win. We could say then that our life is quite similar to an online game.
In each of the days of a human life, some problems arise that we must overcome. A child's problems are easier to solve than those of an adult. As we age, we face more and more difficult challenges. For this reason, video games can be a perfect training for life.
We make many decisions in our daily lives. Some of them are key to determining what our destiny will be. In online games such as Betfair promotions, making the right decisions (and learning from the wrong ones) is crucial to keep moving forward and reach the final goal. It is for this reason that gaming can be of great help when making good decisions. It is not easy, since you need to develop a great capacity for attention and decision.
Many think that online games are harmful to health. Although it does not require a great capacity for movement (except for games that have sensors), gaming helps you develop other very valuable skills for your personal and professional development.

How often or how much you win from online betting depends entirely on the game you choose. In slot games, it is mainly the win multipliers that repeatedly provide free spins or additional cash prizes. However, in sports betting in particular, probabilities can be actively modeled."
679,The best savings accounts of March 2022: Orange Bank or MyInvestor?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/la-mejores-cuentas-de-ahorro-de-marzo-de-2022-orange-bank-o-myinvestor/,02/03/2022,"Orange Bank and MyInvestor have been 2 very profitable accounts and continue to be so.
They started in 2021 offering their savings accounts at 1% APR for an indefinite period, but that changed throughout 2021.
Orange Bank applied a snip to the profitability of its accounts. MyInvestor left that 1% APR only for new clients. Which offer is better in 2022?
The 2 banks continue without asking anything in return from their clients to offer them an account with a profitability above the market and with all services at no cost.
MyInvestor stopped offering its 1% APR indefinitely and only gives that return during the first year. Former customers receive only 0.1% APR. The bank leaves the maximum remunerated limit of money unchanged: €15,000
The Orange Bank change that will take effect from December 1, 2021 will be a reduction of that 1% APR to 0.5% APR. Of course, at 0.5% APR, it pays twice as much money as before, up to €40,000.
During the first year of being a customer, MyInvestor is undoubtedly better, paying twice as much as Orange Bank.
But from the second year onwards, Orange Bank is better by offering you 0.5% APR compared to MyInvestor's 0.1% APR.
Orange Bank rewards a larger amount of money (up to €40,000), while MyInvestor is only €15,000.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
Of course, you must take advantage of MyInvestor's initial promotion wisely.
If you have €15,000 or less (preferably very close to €15,000), hire MyInvestor and take advantage of that 1% APR during the first year, then switch to Orange Bank.
If you have more than €15,000, put the €15,000 in MyInvestor and the rest in Orange Bank or other alternatives that we indicate below.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
680,"Do Santander, BBVA and Sabadell offer an account without commissions and without conditions? Yes, strange?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/santander-bbva-y-sabadell-ofrece-una-cuenta-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condiciones-raro-pero-si/,28/02/2022,"The 3 big banks, famous for their high commissions (along with CaixaBank), sell an account, one online, No Commissions and No Conditions.
It's strange, but it makes sense: Santander already sells an account like this through its online affiliate OpenBank.
BBVA always marketed a free account on Uno-e, but since it ceased to exist, BBVA sells it directly.
Sabadell is recent, but it is at the expense of ActivoBank.
None of the 3 banks ask for anything in return and they give you an account without charges, a lot to say in these 3 entities.
They are accounts very similar to each other and similar to the accounts of online banks such as Openbank, ImaginBank...
It offers even better conditions than ING (which requires at least a monthly transfer).
If we look only at its characteristics, yes. As we have said, it would be the same as online bank accounts.
We always recommend that you look at the features and take advantage of the good offers.
But people have memories, and the 3 banks are famous for their commissions, their changes in conditions and much more.
Convince? From the first opinions of our readers, it seems not... but you never know. There is a reason why Santander, BBVA, and Sabadell accumulate millions of clients.
The 3 accounts are practically a carbon copy. First Santander and then Sabadell copy BBVA's online account point by point.
*The opening only allows 1 single holder. If you wish to add a second owner, you must go to a Sabadell office.
The only difference is the ATMs, which each use their own. Choosing one or the other only depends on which ATMs are best for you.
The Bizum issue, we know that Sabadell allows it and it is free, but by not specifying it in the account conditions, we have left it blank for the moment.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing her friend plan early, according to her announcement and without informing clients.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
681,Last days of the ING Amigo Plan: €40 for opening an account with the help of a client,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ultimos-dias-del-plan-amigo-ing-40e-por-abrir-cuenta-con-la-ayuda-de-un-cliente/,24/02/2022,"ING launched its ING Friendly Plan campaign at the beginning of 2022 and was scheduled to end on January 31, 2022, but they extended it and it will end next February 28.
The Dutch entity does not usually have this promotion active for so long, so it will surely end on that date.
This offer, with which the entity aims to attract new clients for its Payroll Account with the help of its existing clients, offers a bonus of €40 to both the new client (godson) and the existing client (godfather).
The Dutch entity had been giving €50 for years to an ING client with a payroll account, who brings a friend to the entity and direct deposits a payroll or pension, with the friend also taking €50; but during this month of January ING cut the prize to €40, which after taxes are removed, remains at €32.4.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 400 euros gross.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
As we have said, the promotion ends today, February 28, 2022, unless it is extended.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 in commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

682,Last days: €25 in Amazon Check for hiring a Fund in EBN,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ultimos-dias-25e-en-cheque-amazon-por-contratar-un-fondo-en-ebn/,23/02/2022,"EBN Bank is informing its clients via email that ""you still have a few days to get your Amazon Check by making purchases in Funds or Portfolios.""
The offer will last until the next day, March 2, 2022, and it really is a crappy gift, because other entities (recent campaigns from BBVA, ING, Ibercaja or Unicaja Banco) normally offer between 1% and 5% % bonus for the amount contributed. For €10,000 we are talking about €100 to €500.
The only good or semi-good thing about this offer is that the permanence requirement is low. ""Only"" until March 2, 2023. Other entities require years.
>> See details of the promotion
As we have always said, investing in a fund, you do NOT have to look at the gift (it is just an addition). The important thing is to choose the right fund, any fluctuation in its value or even in the commissions that the bank may charge makes this gift insignificant.
But EBN has gone one step further, it is believed that with a pittance of €25 in check Amazon will convince someone to hire an investment fund.
The topics we discuss on our website/blogs are financial products for savers, however we have hundreds of articles where we have reference to Amazon checks, a gift card with which you can buy most of the things that this gigantic store sells. on-line.
Banks use this company as a hook to sell their products in exchange for giving you an AMAZON CHECK. It has been a trend in recent years, replacing the common gifts of before: TVs, Smartphones, microwaves, pans and casseroles (hahaha).
But it has been useful for everything (they are offers that have been in force, but currently, NO, except for the Wizink card):
EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

Will he succeed?",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/nickel-tu-banco-en-un-estanco-triunfara/,22/02/2022,"Nickel was born in 2020 by BNP Paribas to revolutionize banking, and aims to be your neighborhood bank and avoid the financial exclusion of certain areas: medium and small towns.
Nickel allows you to operate through tobacconists and lottery administrations, where you can open current accounts (Spanish IBAN), deposit or withdraw cash or request credit cards.
Currently, it has 731 Nickel points spread throughout Spain.

The big problem with Nickel is that it charges commissions.
The most basic: account + card has an annual cost of €20. Those €20 include free SEPA transfers.
You can receive transfers for free. But if you want to deposit money at a Nickel point you have to pay 2% of the amount deposited.
If you want to withdraw money, you will also have to pay:
We see that there are more interesting alternatives such as Orange Bank or ING, which have no commissions and allow you to withdraw cash for free at most ATMs under certain conditions.
In fact, ING has an agreement with Tobacconists that allows you to withdraw cash at no cost (see here).
It will be useful only for people who NEED to be attended to by a person in areas where there is no alternative to carry out their operations: paying for those services.
You? What do you think?

So we already pointed out that it does NOT declare illegal the fact of requiring the presentation of form 720, but rather illegal the sanctions imposed for not presenting it, which are considered disproportionate, which in cases even exceed the value of the undeclared asset.
Change the regulations that regulate model 720 and adapt it according to the CJEU ruling, that is, reduce the ""disproportionate"" sanctions, and the sanctions and deadlines contemplated in the General Tax Law will be applied:
If you are obliged to present form 720, do it, you have nothing to hide, it does not mean paying more taxes; only what corresponds to you for the returns obtained.
You have until March 31, 2022.
Taxpayers who own any of the following groups of assets abroad that exceed a total of more than 50,000 euros will be required to submit this informative return:
In short, if the total of each of the 3 previous groups of assets does not exceed 50,000 euros, you are not required to present form 720.
Once Form 720 is presented for the first time, in subsequent years, it will only be mandatory when any of the joint balances of the three different blocks of assets mentioned above have experienced an increase of more than 20,000 euros compared to those that determined the presentation of the last statement.

BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
Novum Bank, an entity from Malta, and WITHOUT a branch in Spain, offers a deposit at a high interest, 2.5% APR, and a one-year term.
It would be similar to Wizink, Facto or EBN, but much shorter term. The bad thing is that the money would be abroad and what it entails."

This ruling is the result of a complaint by the Association of Basque Consumers and Users (EKA/ACUV) against this entity.
According to the association, Bankinter, in order to kick customers out of their offices, penalized cash deposits over the counter into an account that you do not own with a commission of 2 euros.
On February 9, the Court declared said commission null and void and ordered the bank to stop collecting it and obliged to return the charges made to date.
«The charging of a commission for a cash deposit made at a Bankinter office does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 93/13, since it constitutes an obvious obstacle for the consumer who intends to make that deposit. ""This obstacle is none other than the imposition of an additional obligation, which we are not aware of has been contemplated in Bankinter's contract with the beneficiary.""
Other entities charge similar commissions for the same operation, and we imagine that they will stop doing so or change the conditions of their contracts to avoid future legal disputes.

The first and most important is that it is an offer exclusively for new customers.
The second is that this profitability lasts only for 12 months from the date of contracting.
And the third is that it is only for €15,000.
In short, MyInvestor pays €10 net to new clients for 12 months (€120) for opening an account and putting €15,000 in it.

The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

The Bank of Spain warned about this (see here), although we have always reminded you that you must read the fine print and accept its conditions.
Logically, if you do not comply, you will be penalized, but the cost never exceeds the benefits they provide, as long as you close the account when you no longer meet the conditions to not pay commissions.
Without further ado, we leave you the current list of offers:
Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you the €350 directly, but that they reward you all that money for leaving only €5,000 in the account for 2 years is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
The offer is valid until March 31, 2022
Up to €300 for clients residing in certain communities (see here), €150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
It will be valid until February 28, 2022.
Cajamar gives €200 in cash if you direct a new payroll to the entity for the first time of at least €1,200 (If it were less, but greater than €950, it would give you €100).
Additionally, it requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.
The offer will be valid until February 28, 2022 or until 2,000 new direct debit payrolls are reached.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until March 31, 2022.
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In exchange, it requires direct debit if you direct your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit of at least 900 euros.
Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become a customer, the bank used to continue offering you new promotions.
It's the stupidest case. How many clients did you attract with your Account 123? And how many clients did you lose with your Santander One?
You spend a lot of money to attract payroll, and you lose it because of a stupid decision and now you have to spend more money again to attract clients, but what we don't know (or we do) is that if people will want to return.
The bank's current offer is that it gives €100 (gross) if the client:
The payment of the promotion will be made to the client's account once the direct debit of the payroll or pension has been verified (on the 7th of each month).
The promotion will be valid until March 31, 2022.
ING has its Friend Plan in force, in which you can give away €40 if you open a payroll account and direct deposit a salary or pension into the account if a friend and client of the bank invites you, who will also take €40 (see more details here)
The advantages of the account are:
Furthermore, having the payroll account exempts you from paying commissions in the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
690,In February you can also get €60 for signing up for the free Wizink card,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/en-febrero-tambien-puedes-conseguir-60e-por-contratar-la-tarjeta-gratis-de-wizink/,09/02/2022,"Wizink maintains its campaign in force during the month of February in which it gives away €60 in Amazon checks for signing up for its free credit card.
This offer has been going on for months without a break, since April 2021, and many of our users have already cashed their check to spend in the Amazon online store.
To earn these €60, the entity only requires that you be a new customer of the card, sign up for it (free) and make the first use: any purchase or cash withdrawal.
There is no cost to the customer, as long as they make sure not to finance their purchases, but rather to pay in full at the end of the month.
Once the requirement has been met, and the entity has verified it, you will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €60 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Once the bonus has been collected, you can forget about the card, continue using it or cancel it. That's your decision.
If you decide to continue using it, you can get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
691,Orange discontinues the Call rate and complicates the registration of the account at 0.5% Orange Bank APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-descataloga-la-tarifa-llama-y-el-alta-en-la-cuenta-al-05-tae-de-orange-bank/,08/02/2022,"Orange has discontinued the Llama rate, a prepaid rate at no cost to customers that users used to register with Orange Bank and take advantage of their account at 0.5% APR, one of the most profitable on the market.
Now, the cheapest rate, also prepaid, is the Go Walk, with an initial cost of €10.
Instead of making it easier for customers to register with Orange Bank, it is complicating it, the opposite of what was announced by its general direct at the beginning of 2021: allowing registration without having to be an Orange customer.
Therefore, from now on, if you want to be an Orange Bank customer you will have to pay an entry toll of €10. Once you are a customer, you can remove yourself as an Orange customer.
In this sense, the ""we help you"" team at Orange Bank has spoken: ""the entity requires that you be an Orange customer to register, but if you later change companies you can continue being an Orange Bank customer, with the only drawback being that you would not be able to benefit from future promotions for Orange customers.
Thus, the process will be:
Once you finish the 3 steps, you can do what you want with the Orange card:
Thus, you can be Orange Bank customers, without being an Orange customer; although during the process you had to be (1 week at most).
It is the only account that is remunerated at 1% APR (the most profitable) and for an indefinite period currently on the market:


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

The promotion will last throughout 2022, until December 31 and requires the new customer to direct debit a payroll or pension of at least €800.
The account, since the payroll is direct debited, is commission-free.
All BBVA customers can join the plan and start inviting their friends and get a bonus of up to €500.

Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.

BBVA is, along with Santander and Sabadell, one of the 3 entities that offer an online account without commissions and without any requirements (see here), but BBVA, by having this promotion, gives it a plus, in addition to being the original bank that launched this product and it has been on the market for a few years now.
Specifically, BBVA offers:
As you can see, BBVA offers much more bonuses to its clients this time (previously, until December, they were only €15).
This offer was activated on February 1, 2022 and will be valid until March 31, 2022.

BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, you can hire it, but you will surely be left out of the Amigo Plan and perhaps some more disadvantages.

This promotion, with which the entity aims to attract new clients for its Payroll Account with the help of its existing clients, offers a bonus of €40 to both the new client (godson) and the existing client (godfather).
The Dutch entity had been giving €50 for years to an ING client with a payroll account, who brings a friend to the entity and direct deposits a payroll or pension, with the friend also taking €50; but during this month of January ING cut the prize to €40, which after taxes are removed, remains at €32.4.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 400 euros gross.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
As we have said, the promotion ends today, February 28, 2022, unless it is extended.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 in commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

695,Online account comparison BBVA vs Santander vs Sabadell. No commissions,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/comparativa-cuenta-online-bbva-vs-santander-vs-sabadell-sin-comisiones/,02/02/2022,"The 3 big banks, famous for their high commissions (along with CaixaBank), sell an account, one online, No Commissions and No Conditions.
First it was BBVA, then Santander imitated it, and now Sabadell. No bank asks for anything in return and gives you an account without charges, a lot to say in these 3 entities.
They are accounts very similar to each other and similar to the accounts of online banks such as Openbank, ImaginBank...
It offers even better conditions than ING (which requires at least a monthly transfer).
If we look only at its characteristics, yes. As we have said, it would be the same as online bank accounts.
We always recommend that you look at the features and take advantage of the good offers.
But people have memories, and the 3 banks are famous for their commissions, their changes in conditions and much more.
Convince? From the first opinions of our readers, it seems not... but you never know. There is a reason why Santander, BBVA, and Sabadell accumulate millions of clients.
The 3 accounts are practically a carbon copy. First Santander and then Sabadell copy BBVA's online account point by point.
*The opening only allows 1 single holder. If you wish to add a second owner, you must go to a Sabadell office.
The only difference is the ATMs, which each use their own. Choosing one or the other only depends on which ATMs are best for you.
The Bizum issue, we know that Sabadell allows it and it is free, but by not specifying it in the account conditions, we have left it blank for the moment.


MyInvestor, Sabadell and Evo Banco currently offer their savings account at 2% APR for a term of 12 months to new customers.
This profitability is extraordinary, since the most profitable deposits only exceed it by a little more than 1 percentage point, in exchange for blocking your money for 1 year or more.
According to the financial consultancy Alvarez & Marsal, which has carried out an examination of Spanish banks with data from the fourth quarter of 2018, the banks with the best grades are Abanca, Kutxabank, Bankinter and BBVA.
The worst: Bankia, Sabadell and Ibercaja
In the month of October, Banco Sabadell suffered a significant flight of deposits due to the legal uncertainty created by the situation in Catalonia, which made it change its headquarters to Alicante.
Now the bank intends to collect money from its clients to recover around 1,000 million euros in deposits through one-on-one calls to its clients to offer a deposit at 0.75% APR."
696,Sabadell launches the Expansión Digital account similar to the BBVA or Santander online account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/sabadell-saca-la-cuenta-expansion-digital-sin-comisiones-similar-a-la-cuenta-online-de-bbva-o-santander/,01/02/2022,"The 3 entities, Santander, BBVA and Sabadell, are feared for their commissions, and the 3 entities launch an online account without commissions and without conditions, a 100% digital account.
The first to launch this type of product was BBVA, which, lacking online banking, made a logical solution.
Then followed Santander, which despite having an online bank (Openbank) and millions of customers in its group, decided to open an online account.
But Sabadell has taken a step further: it limited the opening of accounts in its online office (Activo Bank), to launch this online account, whose characteristics are identical to those of its digital bank.
The characteristics of this account are:
If you go to an office to carry out regular operations such as cash withdrawals or transfers, you will have to pay a commission.
The opening is exclusively for new clients (current clients cannot contract this account) and a single owner. A second owner can be added, but you have to go to one of their offices (we imagine it is free of charge).
It also requires that you be of legal age, reside and pay taxes in Spain, not have US nationality and not have held positions of public responsibility in the last 2 years.
You must open the account using a mobile phone.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."

698,Model 720 declared illegal by the European Justice,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/modelo-720-declarado-ilegal-por-la-justicia-europea/,27/01/2022,"The Court of Justice of the European Union has declared, today, January 27, the obligation to present form 720 illegal, considering that the sanctions and fines are ""disproportionate"" and undermine the free movement of capital in the European Union.
In 2015, the European Commission opened a file against Spain for forcing residents in Spain to report their properties, bank accounts or assets abroad.
As there was no resolution, Brussels brought the case before the CJEU in June 2019 and today the ruling was issued.
It does not declare illegal the fact of requiring the presentation of form 720, but rather illegal the sanctions imposed for not presenting it, which are considered disproportionate, which in cases even exceed the value of the undeclared asset.
I don't think the Treasury wants to stop controlling assets abroad, so they will adapt the law and apply a penalty that is not disproportionate to save this sentence.
Taxpayers who own any of the following groups of assets abroad that exceed a total of more than 50,000 euros will be required to submit this informative return:
In short, if the total of each of the 3 previous groups of assets does not exceed 50,000 euros, you are not required to present form 720.
Once Form 720 is presented for the first time, in subsequent years, it will only be mandatory when any of the joint balances of the three different blocks of assets mentioned above have experienced an increase of more than 20,000 euros compared to those that determined the presentation of the last statement.
Late submission of form 720 or failure to submit it entails consideration as an unjustified capital gain, unless:
Furthermore, due to the emergence of undeclared assets years before, even though they were already owned, it is considered a very serious infraction, punishable by 150% of the differential tax rate of Personal Income Tax, which is the final amount that the taxpayer would have to pay to the Treasury. in a normal situation.
Additionally, for not declaring form 720 on time, you could be penalized:
These sanctions are clearly contrary to European law, but successive governments have continued to apply them. If a sanction is imposed on you, you could go to court, but to avoid problems, it is better to present it, there is nothing to hide.
BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
Novum Bank, an entity from Malta, and WITHOUT a branch in Spain, offers a deposit at a high interest, 2.5% APR, and a one-year term.
It would be similar to Wizink, Facto or EBN, but much shorter term. The bad thing is that the money would be abroad and what it entails."

700,4 fintech trends for 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/4-tendencias-fintech-para-2022/,25/01/2022,"Fintech is essential to optimize the financial processes of large, medium and small companies. Thus, for example, in the online gaming industry, sites like Bethard can offer new alternatives to their users.
Also known as financial technology, today it plays a fundamental role in online transactions: speed, security, new infrastructure, application of cryptocurrencies, among others.
In that sense, we will mention the four fintech trends to take into account for 2022.
The well-known digital banking is already lagging behind in terms of innovations in financial institutions. Now the trend is open banking, or open bank in Spanish.
As its name indicates, it consists of sharing users' financial information with third parties, with the condition that it is secure and under the rules established by the client.
Basically, financial institutions must give access to a third party, authorized by the client, to carry out transactions on their behalf.
Now, many users refuse to use this type of technology, however, in a safe context it can be of great help.
For example, if a person wants to buy a house and gives access to the real estate agency, the real estate agency, with the available information, can present the most comfortable offer for the person, streamlining the entire purchase process.
Since 2021, NFTs have been on everyone's lips and it is expected that by 2022 it will be one of the technologies to achieve consolidation.
Understanding its operation and usefulness is not easy, and that is why many people disregard its importance.
The fact is that an NFT is a unique value (it has a digital authentication certificate), it cannot be modified or exchanged for another since there is no other with the same characteristics.
In principle, they have been associated with art, a new way of buying authentic pieces, however, when it comes to profitability, games based on this technology have the advantage.
In addition, there are NFTs that function as a kind of membership, an access ticket to select groups with certain benefits. So, whoever acquires one of these can sell it for a high price.
Buy now, pay later is a trend that fits the younger generations like a glove.
Its operation is very simple: people can buy in installments without the need for a prior financial study. In addition, it offers the convenience that they can set the deadlines themselves at their convenience.
This practice took a while to reach Spain, but it has already become increasingly popular in the country.
With financial technology, mechanisms can be developed to meet the objectives of sustainable development.
In that sense, in recent years financial alternatives have been created to stop climate change and not threaten biodiversity.
Some examples of this are: sustainable banking, green investment platforms, among others.
All of you who have had more than €50,000 as of December 31, 2023 have to present form 720 and you have until April 1 to do so.
If you do not present it or present it after the deadline, having the obligation, you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency.
One of the reasons why savers do not put money in foreign banks, which normally give more interest than Spanish banks or even foreign banks with a branch in Spain, is the fear of the 720 model.
In this article we will show you how to fill it out and you will see that it is as simple as filling out a form with information that we know.
Since last January 1, the deadline for submitting form 720, the declaration of assets abroad, was opened, if you have had money of a certain amount in foreign banks in 2023.
You have until April 1 to carry out this procedure or you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency."
701,New ING APP and Website. Will there be as many complaints as last time?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/nueva-app-y-web-de-ing-no-habra-tantos-quejas-como-la-vez-anterior/,25/01/2022,"ING has today announced a New Application and a New Website for all its clients. In addition, it will allow all its clients to withdraw money from their payroll accounts in stores, without the need for the Twyp application.
The previous time, more than 6 years ago, there were many complaints about the new website (the current one), and people preferred the classic website (see here). Let's hope this time he gets it right.
To begin with, we give you a positive vote if you allow your customers to withdraw cash in stores and supermarkets directly from the ING APP without the need for an extra APP, Twyp (see here), which in fact, initially, was Twyp Cash, another additional application (see here).
ING created the free Twyp APP, for use by everyone (without being an ING customer), with which you can send and receive money from your friends and also make payments and even withdraw cash in participating stores.
Now, with the new ING APP you can do it directly if you are clients of the Payroll Account (2.7 million clients), and without the Twyp APP.
In the case of Twyp, its use was very simple:
The stores where you can withdraw cash are:
With Twyp, you could make payments at Galp, Shell and Disa gas stations, and you save 4%.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

Open deadline to present model 720",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/tuviste-dinero-en-raisin-nn-bank-en-2021-abierto-plazo-para-presentar-el-modelo-720/,24/01/2022,"If you have had money in 2021 in foreign entities without an office in Spain, such as Raisin or NN Bank deposits, you will have to present form 720 at the Tax Agency.
The deadline for submission began on January 1 and you have until March 31 to do so.
That, yes, does not affect absolutely all savers, only those who had more than €50,000 in foreign banks as of December 31, 2021.
If you are obliged and do not present it, you risk exorbitant fines.
Taxpayers who own any of the following groups of assets abroad that exceed a total of more than 50,000 euros will be required to submit this informative return:
In short, if the total of each of the 3 previous groups of assets does not exceed 50,000 euros, you are not required to present form 720.
Once Form 720 is presented for the first time, in subsequent years, it will only be mandatory when any of the joint balances of the three different blocks of assets mentioned above have experienced an increase of more than 20,000 euros compared to those that determined the presentation of the last statement.
Our ranking of the best deposits includes deposits from foreign banks contracted from Spain (be careful, not all of them are there...):
One of the most interesting offers in foreign banks is OrangeBank, which in 2021 was giving up to 1% APR on your account, but since it has a branch in Spain, the money invested does NOT have to be declared in form 720; It is the same as the money put into ING.
If you had a lot of money abroad, you would also have to declare it in the Bank of Spain, which requires according to Circular 4/2012, of April 25, which came into force on January 1, 2014:
>> More information
In addition, interest generated abroad will not appear on your draft tax return and you will have to include it manually:
>> Declare interests obtained abroad
Late submission of form 720 or failure to submit it entails consideration as an unjustified capital gain, unless:
Furthermore, due to the emergence of undeclared assets years before, even though they were already owned, it is considered a very serious infraction, punishable by 150% of the differential tax rate of Personal Income Tax, which is the final amount that the taxpayer would have to pay to the Treasury. in a normal situation.
Additionally, for not declaring form 720 on time, you could be penalized:
These sanctions are clearly contrary to European law, but successive governments have continued to apply them. If a sanction is imposed on you, you could go to court, but to avoid problems, it is better to present it, there is nothing to hide.
BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
Novum Bank, an entity from Malta, and WITHOUT a branch in Spain, offers a deposit at a high interest, 2.5% APR, and a one-year term.
It would be similar to Wizink, Facto or EBN, but much shorter term. The bad thing is that the money would be abroad and what it entails."

This offer is similar to the “Double Welcome Gift” promotion that the entity has been offering on some occasions.
The bonus is based on the investment made, and we remember, it is only for new Raisin clients:
The minimum investment period for all products is 6 months and the bonus will be deposited:
This promotion will be available only for new customers until March 6, 2022.
We do not recommend anyone make a deposit in a single bank above what is covered by the FGD, which is €100,000 per entity (Raisin does not allow it either).
The welcome bonus must be requested within 6 months after purchasing the first product.
It will be enough to send an email with the subject “Welcome Bonus” toservicio@raisin.es.
In the case of term deposits, the promotion is generally remunerated in the Raisin Account within 14 days of applying.
In the case of savings accounts, it will be necessary for the initial investment to be maintained in a stable and continuous manner during the first six months after opening.
Once this period has passed, the promotion will be paid within 14 days after compliance with the previous conditions.
This platform has dozens of European banks that offer deposits of up to 1.14% APR.
Some of the banks that offer the best profitability on the platform are:
We remind you that deposits are contracted in these banks, and that Raisin is a mere intermediary. Thus, the money is deposited in the countries to which each bank belongs and its consequences:
Some of our users have asked us why Raisin is not included in the records of the Bank of Spain.
And so, it is, because according to Raisin, its business model does not require any authorization/license to operate in Spain.
Your money when transferred to Raisin, is deposited in Raisin Bank based in Germany and under the German FGD.
Once you contract a deposit, the money will be deposited in the collaborating bank and under the FGD of origin of said bank.

704,Interest settlement error in Renault Bank. What has happened?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/fallo-pago-de-intereses-en-renault-bank-que-esta-pasando/,20/01/2022,"Renault Bank made a mistake in the settlement of interest for the month of December 2021, but not to all clients, and apparently, yesterday, the bank has already corrected the error.
Logically, there have been many customers angry at the bank's delay in carrying out the readjustment.
The problem is caused because this French entity paid interest semiannually and during this period there were several interest rate changes.
Specifically, the error was made in the settlement on December 15, 2021, corresponding to the period between June 15, 2021 and December 14, 2021.
The dates that must be taken into account are:
In this way, if you are a client before June 15, you would charge:
We have had an account since September (with a 0.5% APR rate) and we have made a calculation and the settlement was correct.
From what we have read online, many clients were charged a 0.3% APR during the period between September 30 and November 30.
In any case, the bank has executed an extra settlement yesterday to correct the error.
Since January 1, 2022, Renault Bank has started to settle interest on a monthly basis.
The first settlement was on January 15, 2022, corresponding to the period from December 15, 2021 to January 14, 2022.
In this settlement, we have not been aware of any errors.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
705,"The unemployed will already receive €463 per month of Subsidy or RAI in January 2022, €11 more",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/los-desempleados-cobraran-ya-463e-al-mes-de-subsidio-o-rai-en-enero-de-2022-11e-mas/,19/01/2022,"The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
That is the effect of raising the IPREM by 2.5% and that the SEPE aid and limits are referenced to this index:
Amount of unemployment benefits and RAI:
Minimum amount of the benefit.
Maximum amount of the benefit.
The Multiple Effects Public Income Indicator (IPREM) is the reference index used in Spain to calculate the income threshold for the purposes of aid, scholarships, unemployment benefits, free legal assistance, subsidies...
It was the substitute for SMI that before 2004 was used as a reference for this aid.
The IPREM is updated annually and is established in the General State Budget Law.
Since its birth, the IPREM has suffered a progressive upward change and around or below the CPI. But if we compare it with the SMI, it has clearly evolved below this index.
Both indices had the same value for 2004, but in 2020, the IPREM day is at €17.93 while the SMI is at €31.57. This has serious consequences for the unemployed.
Looking at the table, in the last 16 years, beneficiaries of unemployment benefits have lost more than 300 euros per month when their subsidy was referenced to the IPREM instead of the SMI.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The POINTS aid, or family aid for children or benefit for dependent children, is officially collected on the 16th of July and January.
However, there are entities that have already advanced the payment of the aid as of June 25, 2021. We have been able to see the details of the payment from both Banco Santander and Openbank"

The Dutch entity had been giving €50 for years to an ING client (sponsor) with a payroll account, who brings a friend (godson) to the entity and who deposits a payroll or pension with the friend also taking €50; but from now on it will be €40, which after taxes are removed, is €32.4.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 400 euros gross.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
The promotion will last until January 31, 2022 unless extended again.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November 2021, ING decided to charge its clients €120 in commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120

707,The legal and late interest rate will remain the same in 2022: at 3% and 3.75%,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/el-tipo-de-interes-legal-y-de-demora-seguira-igual-en-2022-al-3-y-375/,17/01/2022,"The legal interest rate on money, the one used to settle debt between individuals or the one used by SEPE to allocate income to beneficiaries of subsidies, will remain at 3.00% for the seventh consecutive year according to the Budget Law project. State Generals for 2022.
In the same way, the late payment interest rate, the one used by the Treasury to claim an unpaid debt from you, will remain unchanged at 3.75% for 2022.
It is difficult to understand that the Treasury charges or that SEPE charges you income at these high interest rates, exaggeratedly high if we compare it with the price of money: 0% or the Euribor, reference for most mortgages, which is negative .
It is especially fragrant, because it has consequences in giving you a subsidy or not, that SEPE says that your money produces 3% of income, when it is impossible to obtain those interest rates.
The absurdity is such that the legal interest rate on money and the moral interest rate have been unchanged for 7 years, and in this time, we all know what has happened to the real profitability that we can achieve with our money.

The legal interest on money is the interest rate that is taken as a reference in those loan operations that take place in Spain in which there has not been a prior agreement.
In this way, when there is a loan between individuals, if there is no proof to the contrary (type 0 loan contract), the Tax Agency assumes that the interest generated is at the legal interest rate and charges taxes on it.
This interest rate is also taken as a reference for calculating the income from the assets of unemployed people who receive a subsidy. In this way, the capital or assets at the disposal of the unemployed generate income imputed to the legal interest rate of money.
The late payment interest rate is used to calculate the amount of compensation for damages when the person who must pay a debt is late in his obligation.
In this way, if, for example, we pay a certain tax to the Tax Agency late, this type of late payment interest will be applied to us for the delay.
Banks, which have less and less income due to low interest rates, want to earn more via commissions.
How much do they earn in commissions? Why do they earn less due to low rates?
An Auriga partner, Javier Domínguez, has uttered the following phrases about charging for deposits: ""they will have no choice"" if the current scenario of negative rates continues. ""They are not going to charge because they want to get money, it is because it costs them that money.""
3 sentences, 3 lies.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to keep euro interest rates at the historic low of 0.00% and continue charging 0.4% for money parked in the ECB.
Meanwhile, the profitability of the best deposits continues to fall."

Its customer acquisition offer, €20 welcome, will last until January 31, 2022, however, it is exclusively for customers with an Orange contract mobile line.
In addition to signing up for the account, the bank requires you to use your debit card if you want to get the €20
Users have 30 days from when they become customers to get the €20 bonus.
Orange Bank will immediately deposit your account into your account every time you perform any of the above actions, although its website indicates that it may take up to 30 days.
The bank will pay you up to a maximum of €16.67 in monthly interest if you deposit the maximum amount paid into the account.
Currently, you must put €20,000 in the savings account, which is remunerated at 1% APR, and from there comes €16.67 in interest, subject to withholding.
As of December 1, 2021, the account will remunerate at 0.5% APR, but the limit of remunerated money will double, up to €40,000. So clients will continue to get those €16.67 in interest but depositing double the amount of money in the account.
The characteristics of the account will be as of December 1:
The bank will offer services through a mobile application, from which you can carry out banking operations:
In addition, the application offers a chat from which the customer can interact with bank agents who will offer the help they need.
Orange customers can register with Orange Bank online through its website (orangebank.es) or in the company's own stores.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
709,Comparativa Orange Bank vs MyInvestor en 2022.,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/comparativa-orange-bank-vs-myinvestor-en-2022/,13/01/2022,"Orange Bank and MyInvestor began 2021 by offering their savings accounts at 1% APR for an indefinite period…
But that changed throughout 2021. Orange Bank applied a snip to the profitability of its accounts. MyInvestor left that 1% APR only for new clients. Which offer is better in 2022?
The 2 banks continue without asking anything in return from their clients to offer them an account with a profitability above the market and with all services at no cost.
MyInvestor stopped offering its 1% APR indefinitely and only gives that return during the first year. Former customers receive only 0.1% APR. The bank leaves the maximum remunerated limit of money unchanged: €15,000
The Orange Bank change that will take effect from December 1, 2021 will be a reduction of that 1% APR to 0.5% APR. Of course, at 0.5% APR, it pays twice as much money as before, up to €40,000.
During the first year of being a customer, MyInvestor is undoubtedly better, paying twice as much as Orange Bank.
But from the second year onwards, Orange Bank is better by offering you 0.5% APR compared to MyInvestor's 0.1% APR.
Orange Bank rewards a larger amount of money (up to €40,000), while MyInvestor is only €15,000.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
Of course, you must take advantage of MyInvestor's initial promotion wisely.
If you have €15,000 or less (preferably very close to €15,000), hire MyInvestor and take advantage of that 1% APR during the first year, then switch to Orange Bank.
If you have more than €15,000, put the €15,000 in MyInvestor and the rest in Orange Bank or other alternatives that we indicate below.
After the changes, they are no longer the accounts that were undoubtedly better compared to the rest of the accounts. Now Renault Bank also enters the scene.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

This offer has been going on since April 2021, and in this time more than 100 users of our website have already received their check to spend in the Amazon online store.
To earn these €60, the entity only requires that you be a new customer of the card, sign up for it (free) and make the first use: any purchase or cash withdrawal.
There is no cost to the customer, as long as they make sure not to finance their purchases, but rather to pay in full at the end of the month.

This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Once the bonus has been collected, you can forget about the card, continue using it or cancel it. That's your decision.
If you decide to continue using it, you can get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.

Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
711,Santander continues to give €100 in exchange for payroll until March 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/santander-sigue-dando-100e-a-cambio-de-nomina-hasta-marzo-2022/,11/01/2022,"Banco Santander extends the term of its offer: €100 in exchange for a salary, until March 31, 2022.
The entity launched this campaign in the month of November and initially had the validity date set until December 31, 2021, although it always indicated that it was extendable.
This bonus is obtained by the bank after having kicked out thousands of clients with their commissions from the Santander One account that replaced Account 123.
Many left and the bank, in order to stop the bleeding, backed down, and returned to previous conditions. But the damage had already been done and now he has no choice but to offer €100 to regain payroll.
All this has happened in 2021:
Are you one of those affected? Would you come back? Leave us a comment.
As a requirement, the bank requests the following requirements:
The payment of the promotion will be made to the client's account once the direct debit of the payroll or pension has been verified (on the 7th of each month).
>> More information
The current fees for the Santander One Account are €20 per month, but they will be exempt if one of the following conditions is met:
That is, those who join the €100 campaign will practically have a Santander One Account, without commissions.
You would get a discount of €10 per month if the client meets one of the following conditions:


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

The entity's deposit will continue at 0.25% APR. Rate set in the month of September 2021.
With exceptions: Orange Bank or MyInvestor (during the first year), few banks give more than that 0.3% APR.
Pibank communicated the change almost 2 months ago:
Hello xxxx,
We inform you of the following modifications of the products that make up the Framework Agreement that you have with Pibank:
If you do not agree with the new applicable conditions, you may cancel your Pibank Remunerated Account or your Pibank Payroll Account prior to the date of application. To do so, you will have to inform us of your decision within two months of receiving this communication, without prejudice to compliance with the obligations arising from the contract until the moment of its cancellation.
If you have any questions or queries, you can contact us by phone at 91 111 00 00 or by email at clients@pibank.es

Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."
713,Cajamar also extends its offer of €200 in exchange for payroll until February,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cajamar-amplia-tambien-hasta-febrero-su-oferta-de-200e-a-cambio-de-nomina/,04/01/2022,"Cajamar is extending its offer until February 28, 2022 in which it gives €200 in cash if you direct a new payroll to the entity for the first time.
But be careful, it is not an offer open to all clients, but it is only available to clients selected in the commercial action of “Offer Payroll Direct Debit” available in the offices of the Cajamar Cooperative Group Entities.
Furthermore, to get the €200 you need a salary of at least €1,200. If you don't reach it, but at least exceed €950, you will receive a bonus of €100.
The entity additionally requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In case of non-compliance, the bank will penalize you depending on when you remove the payroll:
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.
The offer will be valid until February 28, 2022 or until 2,000 new direct debit payrolls are reached.
The bonus is deposited into the customer account when it is verified that the first payroll has been deposited.
The client does not actually receive the €200, because it is subject to withholding and at the client's expense. What you will actually charge will be €162 net.
To benefit from this offer you have to go to one of their offices.

714,10 Questions Resolved About ACTIONS,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/10-dudas-resueltas-sobre-acciones/,04/01/2022,"Investing can sometimes seem bewildering and inaccessible. However, it is a very simple concept. A broker, or online stock broker, is the most appropriate way to buy shares. You can access to buy shares on the broker's website in a matter of minutes after creating your account and loading money into it. Also using a full-service stockbroker, or buying shares directly from the company are two other possibilities. Additionally, you can also check the AvaTrade reviews to review different options.
Below is a list of questions and their answers to help you familiarize yourself with the concept of stocks.
Investing in unlisted stocks requires experience and in-depth knowledge of the world of stocks. Unfortunately, beginners often lack this information and can suffer losses because of this. However, if you are only concerned about the future growth of the company, you should consider investing in unlisted stocks.
If you are trading rather than investing for the long term, you can rely on historical charts and price patterns. However, if the investment duration is longer than one year, you should research company news, examine financial statements, conduct competitor analysis, etc.
Using your trading account, you can invest or apply for an IPO online. On the trading platform, search for the IPO (Initial Public Offering) and enter the number of shares you want to purchase and the exact price, then press the confirm button.
All the financial reports of a company can be found on the company's website or on the stock exchanges (NSE or BSE). You can also obtain a copy of the company's annual report and thoroughly examine the financial figures.
Returns are determined by the performance of your performing stocks and non-performing stocks. Some stocks will perform well while others won't, which will influence your results when you have a well-diversified portfolio.
Yes, you can have multiple Demat accounts and trading accounts. However, you can only have one account with an ECN broker listing. If this rule is not met, a maintenance fee will have to be paid for each account.
This depends. An overly diversified portfolio is difficult to monitor and does not provide excellent results. On the other hand, if you have only a few companies in your portfolio, the decline of one of them will negatively influence the rest of your portfolio.
Yes, it can only operate from Monday to Friday from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm. However, beyond these trading hours, you can place AMO (After Market Orders) or Spanish orders; after market orders.
In the stock market, you can invest in 11 different sectors. This type of sector classification helps the portfolio manager build a varied portfolio and allocate assets more efficiently.
Create a watch list and watch stocks that are in this situation while the market is high. Once you've found several attractive stocks, average them to minimize the chances of buying them at such a high price.
We hope these questions have helped you get answers to some important questions about the stock market and stocks.
Online trading or investment has erupted with the force of a tsunami in the world of international finance.
In this article we are going to leave some initial advice for all those looking to take their first steps in this world."
715,Abanca continues to give €150 (or €300) in exchange for payroll until February 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/abanca-sigue-dando-150e-o-300e-a-cambio-de-nomina-hasta-febrero-de-2022/,03/01/2022,"Abanca extends its offer of up to €150 (or €300) until February 28, 2022 in exchange for the direct debit of a payroll or pension.
The entity has been successively expanding this offer that differentiates between the Community of Madrid and Asturias, compared to the rest of the Autonomous Communities, giving €300 to the former and €150 to the rest.
Is this difference justified? We understand that the bank has different targets or objectives depending on the residence of the people. However, many of our users consider it discrimination.
This ""discrimination"" is not so much if we compare it with the Deutsche Bank offer that was in force at the beginning of 2021, which excluded foreigners and those not born in Spain (see here).
The bank's requirements are:
For more information, call 91 090 07 97.
The account allows up to 2 holders with the following advantages:
If you want a credit card, it will be free for the first year.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
716,Will Activo Bank close? You can no longer subscribe to the Active account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/activo-bank-echara-el-cierre-ya-no-se-puede-contratar-la-cuenta-activa/,30/12/2021,"Activo Bank has gone for years without any major news, and now it is because it seems that it is reaching the end of its life.
The entity reports on its website that its Active Account ""cannot be contracted temporarily."" Searching more online, the entity plans to migrate these clients to Banco Sabadell, in a new online account, in the style of BBVA or Banco Santander.
Activo Bank, which currently has 60,000 clients, 500 million euros of resources and 125 million of investment, had better times when the bank competed with the best to attract clients and deposits (see here) and was on the cover of www.tucapital. It is quite frequently.
The Active Account was (is, for those who already have it contracted) one of the accounts without commissions and without market conditions:
It was the first entity to launch immediate and free transfers (see here), but the joy for its clients did not last long, and the bank put a price on that operation (€0.9, see here).
We still do not know what the move that Sabadell will make will be. But if you finally create an Online account in Sabadell and migrate your clients there, there will be no major consequences:
The changes will come in the organization and the customer's treatment with the bank:
We believe it will simply be a commercial image change. The rest will practically be the same. We will see it and we will tell you.
NOTE: our thanks to Toni who alerted us to this news.


In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because he wants to or because he is too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:
Banks are increasingly demanding more from their clients to exempt them from commissions. It's a competition to see who will charge the most (up to €240, see here).
Some (Santander) have already realized that this is not viable and have made some changes to their Account 123 and launched an Online Account without commissions and without links in the style of the BBVA Online account"
717,Openbank advances the payment of the dependent child benefit or the points aid,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/openbank-adelanta-el-pago-de-la-prestacion-por-hijo-a-cargo-o-la-ayuda-de-los-puntos/,29/12/2021,"The dependent child benefit, or the “points” aid commonly called, is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
What we are clear about is that we have been able to verify first-hand that the payment has been made in this entity as you can see in the following screenshot that they have sent us.

The normal thing is that if you have already paid in Openbank, Banco Santander will also have done the same. More banks? Please leave us a comment below.
Last year, no one, absolutely no one received the aid until after the Christmas holidays. In fact, the first payment was on January 15, 2021, just 1 day before what was established by law.
2 banks came forward on the scheduled date to make the payment.
Sabadell was the first bank to start paying, even before the 16th. It was on the 15th at noon (see here).
It was followed by Banco Santander, which also did so on the 15th, but in the afternoon (see here).
On the 16th, several rural savings banks and Openbank paid:
There is contradictory information about Ibercaja (see here), there are people who still do not get paid. We don't know if they don't have the right, if there is an incident.
The worst was the disappointments. ING and Unicaja informed clients that they would be paid on the 16th, but in the end this was not the case.
ING informed its clients, who called to inquire, that they would be paid that day (see here). But at midday the bank was no longer so sure (see here). From what some say, it is because Social Security has not sent the payments (see here). Is rare.
There were also some users who trusted Unicaja (see here) and said that they always paid around 6:00 p.m. even if it was Saturday or Sunday. But it was not like that. Similar problem as with ING?
On the 18th, they will collect the rest. It is the first business day after the 16th.
NOTE, keep in mind that saying the 18th does not mean that the 18th at 00:00 will be in your accounts. It is throughout the 18th.
Residents in Spain with dependent children under 18 years of age and who DO NOT have annual income greater than:
If you have a child with a disability (they may be of legal age), there is no income limit for the family unit.
For greater ease, use the following calculator to determine whether or not you are entitled and the amount of aid that corresponds to you:
Calculator Entitlement and amount of benefit for dependent children Fill in the fields and the program will calculate if you are entitled to the aid and its amount Total annual family unit income: Total number of children under 18 years of age: Number of children under 18 years with disabilities: No. of children over 18 years of age with disabilities >= 65%: No. of children over 18 years of age with disabilities >= 75%: Family situation: Married couple living together Spouse with sole custody Spouse with shared custody Single-parent family Common-law couple living together No. members under 14 years of age: You are NOT entitled to the dependent child benefit Your income exceeds the limit allowed to access this aid See other calculators Powered by www.tucapital.es, the website for the best bank deposits
You must fill out the application form (download here) and submit it along with the required documentation to INSS:
45 days from the request. If they do not respond within that period, the request is considered denied.
Semi-annually, on the 16th of the months of January and July.
In the case of aid for children with disabilities, monthly in arrears.
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The POINTS aid, or family aid for children or benefit for dependent children, is officially collected on the 16th of July and January.
However, there are entities that have already advanced the payment of the aid as of June 25, 2021. We have been able to see the details of the payment from both Banco Santander and Openbank"
718,These will be the best accounts without commissions and without links of 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/estas-seran-las-mejores-cuentas-sin-comisiones-y-sin-vinculaciones-del-2022/,28/12/2021,"Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Even the ""most abusive"" banks have accounts where they don't ask for anything and are free of charge. These are the cases of online accounts from Santander, BBVA or CaixaBank (ImagineBank).
Whoever pays commissions in 2022, unless things change a lot, will be because he wants to or because he is too lazy to change, there are offers, at the moment, for all tastes:
It offers everything for free in exchange for nothing (account, transfers, card, all ATMs 3 times a month), and is one of the few that offers free immediate transfers and also free Bizum.
In addition, it remunerates your money very well, at 0.5% APR for the first €40,000.
The buts:
Perhaps with these buts, many would remove it from this list and we would agree with them, but that 0.5% APR...
Give everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers, and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It does not have immediate transfers, but it does have transfers on the day (before 12:00)
In addition, your money is remunerated at 1% APR for the first €15,000, yes, now only for the first 12 months. Then at 0.1% APR.
This entity, paradoxically part of the Santander group, offers its checking account with everything free (account, debit card, normal transfers, Bizum, and all Banco Santander ATMs can withdraw money) in exchange for nothing.
It is one of the few entities that allows you to go to an office (Santander) to withdraw cash (in addition to Santander ATMs) at no cost.
And if you have a payroll, it offers you a greater bonus: 6 months an account at 5% for €5,000.
You have a savings account that pays up to 0.05% APR (with payroll) or, if not, at the ridiculous interest of 0.01% APR.
A little over 1 year ago, he made his account free for everyone, without any requirements (see here)
Its great advantages, in addition to no commissions and no ties, are:
The downside is that it has very few offices (but there are more than practically the rest of the banks that, even if they have offices, do not allow you to go unless you pay).
This is another entity that gives you everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It also has the friend plan in which you can take up to €150 depending on the links you contract.
The Banco Sabadell online bank offers a free account and debit card with free cash withdrawals at a wide network of ATMs.
CaixaBank's online bank (yes, CaixaBank), without commissions and without ties.
It offers the typical: account, cards, transfers and free bizum.
It seems unbelievable, but yes, BBVA has an account without commissions and without ties. It is the Online Account.
Of course, it is only for new customers. We former clients know that they have been able to contract it, but they have to pay for the cards.
Santander also recently launched an online account, without commissions and without ties. It also requires that you be a new customer.
It is the most recommended entity and generates great trust among its clients. It also offers its Payroll Account for people who do not have a payroll. In exchange, it requires monthly income of at least €700 from another entity.
You will have an account, card and normal transfers at no cost, and you will be able to withdraw cash at a wide range of ATMs and even stores with your Twyp APP.
Additionally, if you have a payroll, the entity usually has the Amigo Plan, in which it gives you €50 (currently not in force).
It has the Orange account which is remunerated, but even more ridiculous than Openbank, at 0.01% APR.
We said about OrangeBank that it had the but of the FGD, here we would say the same: it is Dutch (we repeat, for many it is not a but but rather an advantage).
BE CAREFUL that ING recently requires a condition or will charge a commission on your Orange account if you do not have a payroll account (see here).
Bankinter also offers you an account without commissions, and without the need for payroll, but requires links:
And if you have a payroll, much easier:
The prize is not bad at all. Plus everything free. It pays you well during the first 2 years and for a maximum of €5,000
In total there are €350 of interest that the account can generate.
Accounts proposed by our readers that we add here because they are also interesting:
Abanca Clara Account: No demands and with everything free, included, transfers and Bizum. Additionally, if you domiciliate the payroll before February 28, 2021, it gives you €150.
Cajamar Wefferente Account: No demands and no commissions and as a great advantage you can withdraw cash from €50 for free at any ATM.
N26 Account: It has a Spanish Iban that does not charge you for anything and does not ask you for anything.
Pibank: If you want an account without fees, cards, transfers and withdraw cash at any ATM in the world for free, you have to direct deposit a payroll or pension into Pibank. If you don't do it, you will only have a paid account, although quite well paid, at 0.3% APR.
*OrangeBank limits profitability to the first €40,000.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients and for an initial 12 months and is limited to €15,000.
*Openbank if you domiciliate your payroll, the account is remunerated at 0.05% APR.
Entities that allow cash withdrawals at all ATMs have limitations: number of times or require a minimum amount.
There are entities that only allow withdrawals at their own ATMs and others have agreements with a wide network of ATMs. Check our ATM traffic light (here).
We consider that it has offices, if it has enough. Not like ING or Evo Banco whose number is very small. Openbank only has one office of its own, but you have all the Santander offices to withdraw money for free.
Other entities that have offices, but require payment of commissions if you want to operate in them (cost).
We consider that it does have offices, although it requires certain conditions, such as Abanca, which allows you to withdraw cash for amounts that cannot be done at an ATM.

This first use will not entail any cost or interest either. Simply make a purchase with it, making sure in advance that you have the card configured with full payment at the end of the month (without deferring). We understand that this is the default.
In addition, you will get 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year, €6 per month) in 2 categories that you decide: fashion, leisure, travel, food in stores covered by the program.
The bad thing is that the bank will not grant the card to everyone, it depends on the bank's risk assessment.
The entity, once compliance with the conditions has been verified, will send the customer via email or SMS, in a few days, with instructions to redeem the €60 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."

But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000 (young Bk, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
It is a good offer considering that it is the same (even improved in terms of requirements) as what was offered at least 9 years ago (We published it for the first time in 2012). And since then the landscape of accounts and deposits has changed radically.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
Bankinter offers its friend plan until December 31, 2021 in which it gives €50 to both the godfather and the godson in addition to remunerating your money at 5% APR during the first year and 2% APR during the second year, in exchange for the domiciliation of a payroll.
As a requirement, the bank requires you to sign up for a Payroll Account (domiciliary payroll from €800) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below (enter the email correctly in case the sponsor/godson has to contact you).
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until December 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."
721,ING is closing… in France! and in Spain?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-echa-el-cierre-en-francia-y-en-espana/,22/12/2021,"Calm, calm. ING has confirmed, and announced on its website, that it will close its retail business in France.
Come on, the same business that ING has here in Spain and of which we are clients, about 3 million.
ING has been in France since 2000 as an online bank and currently has around 1 million customers.
The reasons for its closure are due to its business status in the country. In 2020 it presented total losses (retail + wholesale) of profits before taxes of 43 million euros.
Its clients will continue to have banking services while the bank studies transferring it to another entity.
According to the French newspaper Les Echos, SocGen, Credit Agricole and Credit Mutuel were interested.
At the beginning of 2021, ING has already left Austria and the Czech Republic.
In Spain, ING's business is going from strength to strength. In 2020, the entity earned 157 million euros and broke a record in attracting new clients (200,000) from the Payroll Account, up to 2.5 million.
Its income has grown 41% in the last 4 years.
In addition, it is one of the entities that its clients trust the most, and according to the opinion of our users (see here), one of the best banks in Spain.
With all this data, we DO NOT believe that the future of ING in Spain is in danger.



ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

722,Ability to make immediate transfers at no cost to Openbank and others thanks to Bizum,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/conseguir-realizar-transferencias-inmediatas-sin-coste-en-openbank-gracias-a-bizum/,21/12/2021,"Openbank does have the immediate transfer service, the bad thing is that the bank charges you a €4 commission (€2 if it is from the payroll account). However, there is a way to avoid these fees.
We have already talked about using the Bizum service to make immediate transfers between our accounts, but today we tested it and yes, it worked for us, although with a small problem.
To be able to do this operation you must have 2 mobile lines at your disposal. Some circumstances come to mind such as:
The first thing to do is sign up for Bizum in each bank's application using 1 different phone number.
NOTE: if you have 2 accounts in the same bank, money movements between accounts are already immediate.
For this, the first thing you have to do is link the 2 mobile numbers to the 2 accounts. Each bank will be assigned a different number.
In Openbank you can easily do it in the personal data area in the bank's customer area.
It must be done this way, because when you go to register for Bizum at each bank, it will not let you associate any number, but only the number linked to the account. This is the little problem we discussed.
Once associated, you can move the money instantly between both accounts.
If you had to move the money to a different account, you just have to associate one of the Bizum phones to the new account (the operation will not take you even 1 minute).
Basically there are two. First of all, Bizum establishes some limits:
And secondly, not all banks offer this service, although quite a few, we would say the majority:
If your bank is not there, you will not be able to do a Bizum (or send or receive money).
Bizum is a service to send and receive money instantly and without needing to know the Current Account, just the recipient's phone number.
In this way, it is a faster, more agile and friendly service than a bank transfer.
It also allows you to make online payments, and also payments in physical stores (members).
Furthermore, at the moment no bank affiliated with Bizum is going to charge for this service, although you never know in the future. Each bank can set rates and commissions just like any other banking service.
This system has been very well received by people. It is such that even ING, which had a similar system (Twyp), had to join this platform due to the overwhelming request of its clients, of course, only if you have a payroll account.
Currently the banks that offer this service are those in the following list in alphabetical order. If your bank is not there, you will not be able to do a Bizum (or send or receive money).


If your bank does not offer you immediate transfers or charges you for them, you can use Bizum to do so.
We tell you how to do it and its limitations.
A couple of weeks ago we told you that both Unicaja and Orange Bank had lowered the limit of operations per month that will allow their Bizum clients from 150 to 60.
Today we confirm that it is Bizum that will lower this limit and will affect all banks.
Uniaja and Orange will lower the limit of operations per month that Bizum allows from 150 to 60. BBVA also has that limit.
In this sense Orange Bank to its clients and the changes will be effective from June 15 (Unicaja the same)."

All this has happened in 2021:
This €100 offer will last until December 31, 2021, and as indicated on the entity's website, it will be extendable. So it is most likely that in 2022 we will continue to have this offer.
However, we doubt that it is an offer that will convince those who left.
Santander One was the culmination of the continuous changes in the conditions of the entity in recent years. You are one of them? Would you come back? Leave us a comment.

Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.

Of course, you must be one of the first 2,000 customers, since the bank will only give the €20 to the fastest ones.

BBVA has been offering it for years, and Santander, after the failure of Santander One, recently launched it.
They are accounts very similar to each other and similar to the accounts of online banks such as Openbank, Activo Bank, ImaginBank...
Both accounts are outside the norm of BBVA and Banco Santander, which not only asks for your payroll, but also for more connections to be commission-free.
On the other hand, these accounts, without asking you for anything, give you all the services, even under better conditions than ING (which requires at least a monthly transfer).
… And in addition, BBVA gives away €15 (new client) + €5 (customer) in its friend plan to attract clients to its Online Account.
If we look only at its characteristics, yes. As we have said, it would be the same as online bank accounts.
We always recommend that you look at the features and take advantage of the good offers.
But people have memory. Millions of people who had Account 123: from its extraordinary benefits at the beginning, to the crappy commissions at the end; They will not easily forget the continuous changes in conditions at Banco Santander.
Something similar happens to BBVA.
Both accounts are practically a carbon copy. That is to say, Santander has copied BBVA's online account point by point and has launched it on the market in the hope of recovering some of its clients lost due to the (super demanding and super expensive) mistake of its Santander One Account.
The only difference is the ATMs, which each use their own. Choosing one or the other only depends on which ATMs are best for you.
Oh, BBVA has a friend plan that gives €15 for signing up through a friend's recommendation until December 31 (see here)

It is an offer for new clients, like those of other banks, rewarding them via remuneration.
UnicajaBanco now offers in its ""Unpaid Online Account"", what a name by the way, a 2% APR for 1 year if you domiciliate your payroll, and if not, at 1% APR.
This profitability is offered to you for a maximum of €30,000. Look what a coincidence, the same as Banco Sabadell.
But we must also say that Unicaja, starting in the second year, does remunerate your money, at 0.5% APR, unlike Sabadell, which does not.
It is hard for us to believe that ING is not the bank with the most fans, but this is what a study carried out by EMO Insights shows.
The bank with the most fans is Banco Mediolanum with 54.4% of its clients who declare themselves admirers of the entity."

The Italian bank that offered very profitable deposits,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/que-fue-de-cuenta-facto-el-banco-italiano-que-ofrecia-depositos-muy-rentables/,13/12/2021,"Facto Account, the online office of the Italian bank, Banca Farmafactoring, launched its Facto deposit in August 2015 with a profitability of up to 2% APR for all clients and without any requirements, when that interest rate was offered at most by some entities. for new clients.
However, we haven't heard from her for months, what happened?
Over the years, its offering became diluted. But its end (from our radar) was not until March 2021, when the bank decided to lower the profitability of all its deposits to a paltry 0.01% APR (previously 0.6% APR).
Our last news about this bank was when we announced that the bank would stop paying its savings account (previously 0.2% APR) in June 2021.
Since then, no change, no sign, nor have they released those Christmas offers with extra interest rates and we think that they will not return, at least this year.
This is not the only bank that has had a short-lived existence, we highlight 3 other banks:
Other entities that we miss and that were swallowed up by mergers, acquisitions and/or remodeling we can name COINC, Oficina Directa, Banco Popular-e.com, etc.


Days


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."

We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
732,The €60 welcome for signing up for a free Wizink card is still in force,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/los-60e-de-bienvenida-por-contratar-tarjeta-gratis-de-wizink-sigue-en-vigor/,01/12/2021,"The promotion of €60 in Amazon check from Wizink for signing up for your card is still in force. In fact, it has been going on for months without a break.
It has been on their website for a few days without announcing it, but only because they wanted to announce another promotion, but the campaign continued and you could get €60.
Today, the entity has once again promoted this offer on its website, in which it requires you to be a new customer of the card, contract it and make a first use: any purchase or cash withdrawal.
Once compliance is verified, the customer will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €60 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

The new interest rate (0.2% APR) set in July 2021 will not apply to anything that exceeds €50,000, which is not remunerated.
In this sense, the bank has communicated to its clients and indicates that these new conditions will apply from January 31, 2022.
The bank justifies this change by the ""current situation regarding negative market interest rates.""
In this way, the characteristics of the account will be as follows:
For us this change means nothing, because being a foreign bank (without a Spanish IBAN, without a branch in Spain), we no longer make sure not to put in more than that amount to avoid chores:
NN Bank has its Amigo Plan in force until December 31, 2021 in which it gives €25 to both the godfather and the godchild for the simple fact of opening (and little else) a savings account at 0.2% APR and without commissions.
This offer was valid until February 28, but was extended until June 30 and finally until the end of the year.
To get this bonus the bank requires:
As for the friend, it doesn't have to be a real friend of yours (if so, better), on the internet there are many people who offer to be your friend and you both win €25.
If you want, we could help you find a sponsor. We have codes, but if you want you can also organize among yourselves (leave comments below to be a godfather and/or godson).
The client's conditions are:
The conditions of the new client are:
Additionally, Guests who have canceled a Savings Account in the 12 months prior to the start of the promotion will not be able to participate in the promotion.
The Client will receive the €25 bonus at the end of the month in which the guest opens and activates the Online Savings Account.
The new client will receive their €25 at the end of the third month after having activated and deposited the minimum amount of €1,000.

NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account."
734,How to choose a real estate credit intermediary?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/como-elegir-un-intermediario-de-credito-inmobiliario/,30/11/2021,"The real estate credit intermediary is a professional figure that arises after Law 5/2019, of March 15, regulating real estate credit contracts. This regulation, which leaves as a supplementary right the old Law 2/2009 of March 31, which regulates the contracting with consumers of mortgage loans or credits and intermediation services for the conclusion of loan or credit contracts, defines the figure of the real estate credit intermediary in its article 4. 5) as follows:
""Real estate credit intermediary"": any natural or legal person who, not acting as a lender or notary public, develops a commercial or professional activity, in exchange for remuneration, pecuniary or any other form of agreed economic benefit, consisting of placing in contact, directly or indirectly, a natural person with a lender and also performing any of the following functions (...):
It would be a subtype of the more general mortgage intermediary (or mortgage broker in more popular terminology), which mediates mortgage operations with individuals who mortgage a residential asset.
According to the legal definition, to be classified as a real estate credit intermediary, it is not enough to put the client in contact with a bank, but rather it is necessary to offer a service with greater added value, such as collecting the necessary documentation and information (mortgage file), presenting the operation to the banks that have the product and negotiate, if possible, the conditions.
The professionalization of the mortgage intermediation sector
Although mortgage intermediation has been in Spain for many years, it is not until the publication of Law 5/2019, a somewhat watered-down transposition of Directive 2014/17/EU, that we can speak of a truly professionalized sector, with the supervision of the Bank. of Spain, transparency obligations similar to the banks themselves and mandatory registration in a public registry (Registry of real estate credit intermediaries and real estate lenders).
Furthermore, the emergence of essentially online mortgage intermediation businesses (hypotech sector), which has exploded after the Covid-19 pandemic, has multiplied the offer of these services.
7 tips for choosing a mortgage broker
In the comparator of online mortgage intermediaries managed by Futur Finances, which is based on companies with legal personality registered with the Bank of Spain, there are already 269 records.
Knowing the parameters to take into account when selecting one of these professionals is extremely useful with such a wide offer.
The parameters to study before hiring a mortgage broker are:
Signing a mortgage loan to finance the purchase of a first home is probably the most important financial decision in a person's life. Getting it right is not a matter of luck: the services of a mortgage negotiation management professional are a great help. As long as a professional is chosen, of course.
Pau A. Monserrat, economist and CEO of Futur Finances.
Something unprecedented has happened, the plenary session of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court rules out its Second Section, and indicates that the IAJD Tax must be paid by the client.
Those affected can only wait for a favorable ruling from the CJEU, as already happened with the floor clause.
We indicate what can currently be claimed.
If you have a mortgage or have had one, you have the right to claim the costs of formalizing it from your bank and it is not a nonsense, it can be thousands of euros.
According to several sources, by declaring these clauses abusive, they are void by law and therefore, there is no time limit to initiate the claim.
The interest rate on fixed-rate mortgages is at historic lows, around 2%, lower than what clients with variable mortgages paid before the crisis.
They are a good option because they are cheap and because you will live peacefully or at least not worry about the mortgage for the rest of your life."

It remains, therefore, only today and tomorrow at 0.5% APR and starting Wednesday, all Contigo Accounts will be paid at 0.3% APR as for new customers.
It is the second cut by this entity on this product that was launched together with the creation of the entity less than 1 year ago and offered at 0.65% APR (see here).
The previous time was in the month of July when it established the interest rate of 0.5% APR.
The characteristics of the account will be like this for all clients starting Wednesday:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
The entity maintains the Tú Deposit unchanged, which remains at 0.5% APR
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.

The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.

736,These are the 7 accounts that offer money for your payroll: ranking November 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/estas-son-las-7-cuentas-que-ofrecen-dinero-por-tu-nomina-ranking-noviembre-2021/,26/11/2021,"In November we have up to 7 entities that offer money if you direct your payroll to their bank. Your salary has value, at least they spend it to get it from you, offering you up to €350 in cash.
Of course, they will ask you, like mobile or internet companies, for a permanence and some other demands.
The Bank of Spain warned about this (see here), although we have always reminded you that you must read the fine print and accept its conditions.
Logically, if you do not comply, you will be penalized, but the cost never exceeds the benefits they provide, as long as you close the account when you no longer meet the conditions to not pay commissions.
Without further ado, we leave you the current list of offers:
Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you the €350 directly, but that they reward you all that money for leaving only €5,000 in the account for 2 years is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
Additionally, you can get another €50 if you sign up for the account via their Friend Plan (See here).
The offer is valid until December 31, 2021
Up to €300 for clients residing in certain communities (see here), €150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
It will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Cajamar gives €200 in cash if you direct a new payroll to the entity for the first time of at least €1,200 (If it were less, but greater than €950, it would give you €100).
Additionally, it requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.
The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021 or until 2,000 new direct debit payrolls are reached.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Ibercaja offers new customers €150 in cash who deposit a payroll of at least €1,500 in the entity into the Vamos Account.
Specifically, this offer will be valid until November 30, 2021, requiring a 24-month stay under penalties.
The entity accepts both payroll and pension or unemployment benefits as income.
The bonus payment will be made to the account within the month following receipt of the first income, which will be subject to personal income tax withholding.
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In exchange, it requires direct debit if you direct your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit of at least 900 euros.
Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become a customer, the bank used to continue offering you new promotions.
It's the stupidest case. How many clients did you attract with your Account 123? And how many clients did you lose with your Santander One?
You spend a lot of money to attract payroll, and you lose it due to a stupid decision and now you have to spend more money again to attract clients, but what we don't know (or we do know) is that if people will want to return.
The bank's current offer is that it gives €100 (gross) if the client:
The payment of the promotion will be made to the client's account once the direct debit of the payroll or pension has been verified (on the 7th of each month).
The promotion will be valid until December 31, 2021.
ING usually gives away €50 (NOT in force) if you open a payroll account and direct deposit a salary or pension into the account if you are invited by a friend and client of the bank, who will also take €50 (see more details here)
The advantages of the account are:
Furthermore, having the payroll account exempts you from paying commissions in the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
737,Is it worth moving your money to an account that only earns €10/20/100 interest per year?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/merece-la-pensa-mover-tu-dinero-a-una-cuenta-que-te-solo-10-20-100e-de-intereses-al-ano/,25/11/2021,"Today we read a comment from a user of our website who says that it is not worth moving your money (€40,000) to Orange Bank for a pittance of €167 in interest per year, and we want to open a debate.
In reality, currently it would be moving €20,000 to obtain that interest and as of December 1, €40,000 will be required, but in this case it doesn't matter.
We already spoke once, and in reference to ING (see here), which is a bank that charges you absolutely nothing, however, we stated that it could cost you money. As? This is what is called opportunity cost in economics.
Let's imagine that you have €10,000 at the beginning of the year (and that you don't spend it, of course), because depending on where you put the money, at the end of the year you will have €10,000 (at ING) or €10,040 (at Orange Bank).
What happen? Well, Orange Bank gives you €40 of net interest and ING, €0. Or if we look at it another way, it is as if ING had charged you €40 in commissions.
What would you do if a bank told you that it charged €40 in commissions? Would you change banks? We, yes.
NOTE 1: we have compared Orange Bank vs ING, because both accounts are commission-free and offer everything for free. In this part, we have not entered into assessments of which bank performs better, only in terms of profitability or cost.
NOTE 2: ING, if you meet the payroll account requirements, would pay you €1 of interest per year for those €10,000. There is no big difference for what we are talking about.
According to Wikipedia: opportunity cost ""designates the cost of an investment at the expense of the best alternative investment available, or also the value of the best option not realized.""
Let's say it is the cost of our choice compared to another better option that exists on the market.
We continue without going into subjective issues and personal preferences of which bank works better, we are going to make a comparison of the characteristics of both accounts in objective terms.
(*1): The Orange Account is paid at 0.01% APR if you meet the payroll account requirements
(*2): If you meet the payroll account requirements. If it is not met, you will not have a card, and you cannot deposit more than €30,000 in the Orange Account or they will charge you €10 commission per month.
(*3): ING ATMs: from any amount at all Banco Popular, Banco Pastor, Targobank, Banca March and ING ATMs. From €50 at all Bankia ATMs and from €200 at all other entities.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

Its customer acquisition offer, €20 welcome, will last until January 31, 2022, however, it is exclusively for customers with an Orange contract mobile line.
In addition to signing up for the account, the bank requires you to use your debit card if you want to get the €20
Users have 30 days from when they become customers to get the €20 bonus.
Orange Bank will immediately deposit your account into your account every time you perform any of the above actions, although its website indicates that it may take up to 30 days.
The bank will pay you up to a maximum of €16.67 in monthly interest if you deposit the maximum amount paid into the account.
Currently, you must put €20,000 in the savings account, which is remunerated at 1% APR, and from there comes €16.67 in interest, subject to withholding.
As of December 1, 2021, the account will remunerate at 0.5% APR, but the limit of remunerated money will double, up to €40,000. So clients will continue to get those €16.67 in interest but depositing double the amount of money in the account.
The characteristics of the account will be as of December 1:
The bank will offer services through a mobile application, from which you can carry out banking operations:
In addition, the application offers a chat from which the customer can interact with bank agents who will offer the help they need.
Orange customers can register with Orange Bank online through its website (orangebank.es) or in the company's own stores.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

Evo Banco has been offering a discount on the purchase of Amazon checks for quite some time now and it will last until June 30, 2022.
The entity discounts your purchase with an extra 3%. If you buy a check worth €100 (it costs you €100), Evo Banco will give you a check worth €103.
Or looked at another way, if you want, for example, the final amount of the check to be €100, you must buy one for €97.08 (€100/103). You pay €97.08 and get a check for €100.
The bad thing is that Evo Banco does not allow you to do that, since it has to be in sections of €10 and for a minimum value of €20; So if you don't want to have money in Amazon, adjust the check to the closest price and pay the rest with another means of payment.
The process is very simple:
You can buy checks for a minimum value of €20 and up to a maximum of €2,000, and in installments of €10.

740,"I collect the Minimum Income or less from the SMI, can the money in my account be seized?",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/cobro-la-renta-minima-o-menos-del-smi-me-pueden-embargar-el-dinero-de-la-cuenta/,22/11/2021,"The money in a bank account or deposit is at the top of the list of things to seize, and is the administration's main mechanism for collecting tax debts, fines, or fees, but also judicial rulings.
Of course, you cannot do it just any way, the bank must respect certain codes of good conduct:
NO, as soon as the seizure order is received, it is communicated to the client, and the balance (until the debt is covered) will be blocked and/or transferred to the administration or the court.
Your debt will continue (what remains to be paid) and at any time they can request a new seizure of the account, but it cannot be seized automatically.
If it were a tax debt, the bank will surely have orders to communicate any change in the account to the Treasury, which will request a new seizure.
It is advisable not to enter anything else into that account except for payroll, pension, benefits...
There is a minimum, necessary for you to survive and that depends on the SMI, the payroll or income that cannot be seized and must be left in the Account.
Thus, all people who receive the Minimum Income or any salary less than the SMI, cannot be seized.
The money that accumulates in the account, if it comes from your income, cannot be seized either. The minimum necessary to live does not mean that you have to spend it in the month, but that you may need it for later.
There is some news on the web that indicates that it could be seized, but, not, if you demonstrate that this income comes exclusively from the non-seizable payroll (Article 171.3 LGT).
In this sense, there are resources that have been accepted by the Treasury (see document extracted from www.politicafiscal.es).
If an embargo occurs on an account where there are several owners, the bank will not distinguish who owns the money. The embargo will be applied to the entirety.
Of course, if one of the owners is not the seized person, they can claim their part of the money (in court). If you think that they are going to seize you, it is best that you do not have accounts with other people so as not to affect them.
The phrase that appears in NN Bank: ""Your money always available, with up to €100,000 guaranteed by the Dutch Deposit Guarantee System and supervised by the Bank of Spain"" has caused certain doubts among our users.
Does the bank have Spanish Iban? Why is it supervised by the Spanish Bank (BdE) if it is a foreign entity? Can the entity's deposited money be confiscated?
The money in a bank account or deposit is at the top of the list of things to seize, but it cannot be done in any way; the bank must respect codes of good conduct or criteria for good banking practices."

Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
742,"Subsidies and RAI will be €463 per month in 2022, €11 more",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/los-subsidios-y-la-rai-seran-de-463e-al-mes-en-2022-11e-mas/,18/11/2021,"If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
That is the effect of raising the IPREM by 2.5% and that the SEPE aid and limits are referenced to this index:
Amount of unemployment benefits and RAI:
Minimum amount of the benefit.
Maximum amount of the benefit.
The Multiple Effects Public Income Indicator (IPREM) is the reference index used in Spain to calculate the income threshold for the purposes of aid, scholarships, unemployment benefits, free legal assistance, subsidies...
It was the substitute for SMI that before 2004 was used as a reference for this aid.
The IPREM is updated annually and is established in the General State Budget Law.
Since its birth, the IPREM has suffered a progressive upward change and around or below the CPI. But if we compare it with the SMI, it has clearly evolved below this index.
Both indices had the same value for 2004, but in 2020, the IPREM day is at €17.93 while the SMI is at €31.57. This has serious consequences for the unemployed.
Looking at the table, in the last 16 years, beneficiaries of unemployment benefits have lost more than 300 euros per month when their subsidy was referenced to the IPREM instead of the SMI.
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
The POINTS aid, or family aid for children or benefit for dependent children, is officially collected on the 16th of July and January.
However, there are entities that have already advanced the payment of the aid as of June 25, 2021. We have been able to see the details of the payment from both Banco Santander and Openbank"
743,EBN deposits: NOT cancelable by you; YES cancelable by the bank,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/depositos-ebn-no-cancelable-por-ti-si-cancelable-por-el-banco/,17/11/2021,"It's the world upside down, but yes, that's what EBN deposits are like, which the entity relaunched its marketing yesterday and aimed at all clients.
SinyCon Plus deposits do not allow their clients to cancel them early, however, the bank can modify or cancel the deposit before it expires.
This is established in point 8 of the ""particular conditions"" of the EBN SinyCon deposit contract and also in the bank's general conditions (end page 5, see here). Is it legal?

We believe that the bank wants to protect itself from future changes in strategy or even changes in the interest rate.
According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. It is the first deposit that we see this clause.
Yesterday the bank relaunched these deposits for the contracting of all clients with a reduced profitability, but still interesting if we compare it with the rest of the banks:
The characteristics, highlighting the issue of early cancellation, are:
On January 1, 2022, EBN Banco will lower the profitability of its Remunerated Account from the current 0.15% APR to 0.05% APR.
The characteristics of the account will be:
Its contract is automatic if you make a deposit in the bank, or you can exclusively contract the account.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

745,Do BBVA and Santander offer an account without commissions and without conditions?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bbva-y-santander-ofrecen-una-cuenta-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condiciones/,15/11/2021,"The 2 big banks, which are famous for their high commissions (along with CaixaBank), sell an account, one online, No Commissions and No Conditions.
BBVA has been offering it for years, and Santander, after the failure of Santander One, recently launched it.
They are accounts very similar to each other and similar to the accounts of online banks such as Openbank, Activo Bank, ImaginBank...
Both accounts are outside the norm of BBVA and Banco Santander, which not only asks for your payroll, but also for more connections to be commission-free.
On the other hand, these accounts, without asking you for anything, give you all the services, even under better conditions than ING (which requires at least a monthly transfer).
… And in addition, BBVA gives away €15 (new client) + €5 (customer) in its friend plan to attract clients to its Online Account.
If we look only at its characteristics, yes. As we have said, it would be the same as online bank accounts.
We always recommend that you look at the features and take advantage of the good offers.
But people have memory. Millions of people who had Account 123: from its extraordinary benefits at the beginning, to the crappy commissions at the end; They will not easily forget the continuous changes in conditions at Banco Santander.
Something similar happens to BBVA.
Both accounts are practically a carbon copy. That is to say, Santander has copied BBVA's online account point by point and has launched it on the market in the hope of recovering some of its clients lost due to the (super demanding and super expensive) mistake of its Santander One Account.
The only difference is the ATMs, which each use their own. Choosing one or the other only depends on which ATMs are best for you.
Oh, BBVA has a friend plan that gives €15 for signing up through a friend's recommendation until December 31 (see here)


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

Which we expected because the entity reduced its deposits to 0.25% APR.
It also lowers the profitability of your Payroll Account from 0.5% APR to 0.3% APR on the same day.
Hello xxxx,
We inform you of the following modifications of the products that make up the Framework Agreement that you have with Pibank:
If you do not agree with the new applicable conditions, you may cancel your Pibank Remunerated Account or your Pibank Payroll Account prior to the date of application. To do so, you will have to inform us of your decision within two months of receiving this communication, without prejudice to compliance with the obligations arising from the contract until the moment of its cancellation.
If you have any questions or queries, you can contact us by phone at 91 111 00 00 or by email at clients@pibank.es
Thank you for trusting Pibank

Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."
747,There are still a month and a half left for the Bankinter Amigo Plan: €50+€50 and 5% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/aun-quedan-mes-y-medio-para-el-plan-amigo-bankinter-50e50e-y-5-tae/,11/11/2021,"Bankinter offers its friend plan until December 31, 2021 in which it gives €50 to both the godfather and the godson in addition to remunerating your money at 5% APR during the first year and 2% APR during the second year, in exchange for the domiciliation of a payroll.
As a requirement, the bank requires you to sign up for a Payroll Account (domiciliary payroll from €800) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below (enter the email correctly in case the sponsor/godson has to contact you).
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until December 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).
>> See promotion bases
Until July 31, 2021, Bankinter offers its offer to remunerate you at 5% APR during the first year, and a second year at 2% APR for the money you deposit in the Payroll Account.
But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000 (young Bk, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
It is a good offer considering that it is the same (even improved in terms of requirements) as what was offered at least 9 years ago (We published it for the first time in 2012). And since then the landscape of accounts and deposits has changed radically.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
The total bonus for both promotions would be €400 gross (€260 in the case of Bk Young) or €324 net (after paying taxes) for the new customer. The bank spends €450 for each payroll.
Be careful, only the Payroll Account is worth it. If you do not have a payroll, you will only be able to get €350 in interest.
It is a good offer and a good alternative to attract those dissatisfied with the latest changes at BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Bankia or even Banco Sabadell.
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:
This offer will be available until July 31, 2021. Offer valid until 40,000 new accounts have been contracted.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."

The process will last the entire weekend starting Friday afternoon, without specifying a time, and will return fully operational starting Monday, November 15, but it will now be as a single bank.
During this time clients will have limited some services:
The fundamental changes will be:
With all these changes, the client does not have to do anything with their accounts, cards and direct debits, since the data migration will be executed automatically.
As of November 12, the card contracts will be transferred to the bank resulting from the merger.
The debit card will have commissions (€36 commission per year) even if you comply with the Day to Day Account links.
Of course, clients who meet the requirements of the plan in the month of October: direct deposit of payroll and take out insurance, investment fund or use the credit card twice a month, will continue with the debit card for free, and until June 2022.
If you want to continue with Caixa Bank (we don't understand your reasons), you will have to cancel the debit card and sign up for a credit card (MyCard) associated with the Day by Day account, which is free.
As of November 12, Bankia's On Account will be transferred to the Day by Day account.
As of October 1, 2020, this account requires compliance with the following 2 conditions to be free of commissions:

If you only meet the first condition, the bank will charge you €15 in commission quarterly (€60 per year).
If you do not meet any of the conditions, the commission amounts to €60 per quarter (€240 per year).
Oh, and be careful, you can only operate through their digital channels or at ATMs, since if you do it in their offices, they will charge you 2 euros per operation (Those over 65 years of age can carry out 4 free operations per month).
NOTE: The products to take into account for the €20,000 are: investment funds, fund portfolios, structured funds, managed portfolios, savings insurance and individual pension plans.


As we said a few days ago, Caixa Bank will eliminate the Bankia On Account and all its conditions and they will be transferred to the Day to Day Account with payment of up to €240 commission if you do not join (see here).
But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year.
CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022.
Last Friday, Bankia merged with CaixaBank, with the CaixaBank name prevailing due to its prestige unlike Bankia.
But this predominance goes beyond its simple name, also in terms of marketing and product policy.
At the moment, Bankia's On Account, its most interesting account, has fallen"

Currently this account pays interest every 6 months, therefore we believe that the change is for the better for clients who will see their savings paid monthly.
The entity also informs its clients that from now on it will communicate any modification to its conditions and individually at least 2 months in advance of the date of entry into force.
Of course, if it is a change in favor of the client, it can be applied immediately and without prior notice.
Customers prior to September 30 continue to enjoy their Contigo Account at 0.5% APR, but only until November 30.
Starting in December, these accounts will be remunerated like new clients, at 0.3% APR.
It is the second cut by this entity on this product that was launched together with the creation of the entity less than 1 year ago and offered at 0.65% APR (see here).
The new features are:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
The entity maintains the Tú Deposit unchanged, which remains at 0.5% APR
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.

In this sense, the bank is communicated to its clients via email:

The account characteristics are:
EBN suspended the marketing of all its deposits almost 1 year ago, but its clients have been able to renew their deposits since then.
However, recently, in the month of October, the bank has considerably cut the profitability of these deposits and now it is not even a shadow of what it was.
Already in February 2021 the entity made a good cut in the remuneration of these products, currently it is even worse.
Their deposits were characterized by their ""high profitability"", their impossibility of early cancellation and the possibility of being canceled by the bank (see here).

For financial institutions, your payroll is worth money, at least they spend it to get it from you, offering you up to €350 in cash.
Of course, they will ask you, like mobile or internet companies, for a permanence and some other demands.
The Bank of Spain warned about this (see here), although we have always reminded you that you must read the fine print and accept its conditions.
Logically, if you do not comply, you will be penalized, but the cost never exceeds the benefits they provide, as long as you close the account when you no longer meet the conditions to not pay commissions.
Without further ado, we leave you the current list of offers:
Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you the €350 directly, but that they reward you all that money for leaving only €5,000 in the account for 2 years is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
Additionally, you can get another €50 if you sign up for the account via their Friend Plan (See here).
The offer is valid until December 31, 2021
Up to €300 for clients residing in certain communities (see here), €150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
It will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Cajamar gives €200 in cash if you direct a new payroll to the entity for the first time of at least €1,200 (If it were less, but greater than €950, it would give you €100).
Additionally, it requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.
The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021 or until 2,000 new direct debit payrolls are reached.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In exchange, it requires direct debit if you direct your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit of at least 900 euros.
Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become a customer, the bank used to continue offering you new promotions.
ING usually gives away €50 (NOT in force) if you open a payroll account and direct deposit a salary or pension into the account if you are invited by a friend and client of the bank, who will also take €50 (see more details here)
The advantages of the account are:
Furthermore, having the payroll account exempts you from paying commissions in the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
753,Now Santander gives €100 if you bring your payroll. A disaster of commission politics,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ahora-santander-da-100e-si-llevas-tu-nomina-un-desastre-de-politica-de-comisiones/,02/11/2021,"How many clients did Banco Santander attract with its Account 123 and its then good conditions?
How many clients will the bank have lost with the terrible conditions of the Santander One account?
The initial conditions of the Santander One did not last even 6 months. The bank had to back down and return to conditions similar to Account 123 from the last period of its life (see here).
That change, at the beginning of 2021, was the final touch of a series of changes for the worse in Account 123, which scared away thousands and thousands of clients, and which we believe will never return.
Now the bank, to fix this mess, launches a promotion that gives away €100 (gross) to capture those payrolls again:
The payment of the promotion will be made to the client's account once the direct debit of the payroll or pension has been verified (on the 7th of each month).
The promotion will be valid until December 31, 2021.
>> More information
The current fees for the Santander One Account are €20 per month, but they will be exempt if one of the following conditions is met:
That is, those who join the €100 campaign will practically have a Santander One Account, without commissions.
You would get a discount of €10 per month if the client meets one of the following conditions:
You will come back? Leave us a comment.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
754,BFS offers deposits of up to 0.65% APR in November,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-ofrece-en-noviembre-depositos-de-hasta-065-tae/,02/11/2021,"BFS deposits are still quite profitable when compared to deposits from other entities. It offers up to 0.65% APR, but for large investors.
To offer you this profitability you have to invest at least €50,000, an amount that not all savers have.
If you have at least €25,000 or more, the bank also gives you the option of investing in its deposits, but the interest rate will be 0.1 percentage points less.
Its profitability is surpassed by few banks, such as Orange Bank or MyInvestor, which offer a 1% APR on their savings accounts with limitations (see here) and Orange Bank is planning a cut in half (0.5% APR) from December 2021.
The characteristics of these products are:
These products have 2 disadvantages:
The entity is of Portuguese origin, but for the moment it continues to appear on the list of the Spanish FGD. The bank announced its merger with its Portuguese parent company (Portuguese FGD), but we do not yet have confirmation from the bank if it has taken place.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
755,How to transfer money instantly between your accounts with Bizum?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/como-transferir-dinero-de-forma-instantanea-entre-tus-cuenta-con-bizum/,29/10/2021,"If your bank does not offer you immediate transfers or charges you for them, you can use Bizum to do so.
Logically, the accounts involved must allow you to do a Bizum. This is the case in most bank accounts.
The buts, that you need 2 mobile lines and for movements of a small amount of money (within the limits of Bizum).
Keep in mind that Bizum associates an account with a mobile number. Once configured (from the bank's APP), you can send money from one of your accounts (Mobile No. 1) to another of your accounts (Mobile No. 2).
In addition, the change (associating number to account) is done instantly, you can configure it according to your needs at all times.
Bizum's general limits are:
Bizum is a service to send and receive money instantly and without needing to know the Current Account, just the recipient's phone number.
In this way, it is a faster, more agile and friendly service than a bank transfer.
It also allows you to make online payments, and also payments in physical stores (members).
Furthermore, at the moment no bank affiliated with Bizum is going to charge for this service, although you never know in the future. Each bank can set rates and commissions just like any other banking service.
This system has been very well received by people. It is such that even ING, which had a similar system (Twyp), had to join this platform due to the overwhelming request of its clients, of course, only if you have a payroll account.
Currently the banks that offer this service are those in the following list in alphabetical order. If your bank is not there, you will not be able to do a Bizum (or send or receive money).
Openbank does have the immediate transfer service, the bad thing is that the bank charges you a €4 commission (€2 if it is from the payroll account). However, you can use Bizum and it will be free.
We tell you how to do it.
A couple of weeks ago we told you that both Unicaja and Orange Bank had lowered the limit of operations per month that will allow their Bizum clients from 150 to 60.
Today we confirm that it is Bizum that will lower this limit and will affect all banks.
Uniaja and Orange will lower the limit of operations per month that Bizum allows from 150 to 60. BBVA also has that limit.
In this sense Orange Bank to its clients and the changes will be effective from June 15 (Unicaja the same)."
756,OrangeBank gives you €20 for opening your account at 1% APR and using your card until January 2022,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orangebank-te-da-20e-por-abrir-su-cuenta-al-1-tae-y-usar-su-tarjeta-hasta-enero-2022/,28/10/2021,"Orange Bank from October 1, 2021 until January 31, 2022 offers a €20 welcome bonus to new customers who sign up for their account at 1% APR (only until November 30, then at 0.5% APR) and use your debit card.
The catch is that this offer is exclusively for customers with an Orange contract mobile line.
The €20 bonus is distributed as follows:
Users have 30 days from when they become customers to get the €20 bonus.
Orange Bank will immediately deposit your account into your account every time you perform any of the above actions, although its website indicates that it may take up to 30 days.
As of December 1, 2021, Orange Bank will reduce the profitability of your account by half, to 0.5% APR, but will increase the limit of remunerated money by double, up to €40,000 (previously €20,000).
The end result is that you will pay a maximum of the same amount in interest to your clients, but they have to leave twice as much money.
The characteristics of the account will be as of December 1:
The bank will offer services through a mobile application, from which you can carry out banking operations:
In addition, the application offers a chat from which the customer can interact with bank agents who will offer the help they need.
Orange customers can register with Orange Bank online through its website (orangebank.es) or in the company's own stores.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
757,Do you want to know how transfers work? When do you arrive at your destination?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/quieres-saber-como-funcionan-las-transferencias-cuando-llega-a-su-destino/,26/10/2021,"A transfer is an operation by which a person (the payer) instructs his or her bank to send a certain amount of money from his or her account to the account of another person (the beneficiary of the transfer) in the same bank. or in another entity.
With the entry into force of the new Payment Service law, we make a transfer in euros and both the payer's entity and the beneficiary's entity are in the European Union, the payer's entity, after receiving said order, will ensure that the amount transferred is credited to the account of the beneficiary's entity, at the latest, at the end of the next business day.
This has been the case since January 1, 2012.

For the purposes of business days, all commercial opening days on which the TARGET payment system of the European Union operates are considered.
This excludes Saturdays, Sundays and national, regional and local holidays, as well as TARGET closing days (January 1, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May 1, December 25 and 26).
They are taken into account depending on where the accounts have been opened, both origin and destination of the transfer.
It does not matter where the transfer order is executed (ATM, Internet, etc.), the business days taken into account are those of the location where the source and destination accounts of the money have been opened.
If an account has been opened from the Internet, the business days of the location where the entity's Headquarters are located are considered.
In this way, for example, ING Direct is considered Madrid business days (See more in the image on the right).
It is the time from which the transfer is considered to have been made on the next business day.
It is very important to take this time into account, since depending on whether we make the transfer before or after that time, the transfer will take us 1 business day less or more respectively from the execution of the order.
There are entities that allow you to issue transfers on the same day, with more restrictive cut-off times.
The banks that have this service and their cut-off times are:
They are transfers that you issue and they reach the recipients instantly. The problem is that not all banks offer them and if they do, they are free:
Another alternative would be to use Bizum which is also instant but has more limitations (see here).
The Payment Service law indicates that in bank transfers in the European Union and in Euros, at most, the money must arrive the next business day.
But be careful, that does not mean that when you request a transfer, the money has to arrive the next day (business day or not), the key, the bank's cut-off time.
Since 2012, transfers according to the Payment Services Act (SEPA) (normal) bank transfers take 1 business day. That is, if you issue a transfer today (business day), the money will arrive at the destination entity the next business day.
ING goes one step further, and makes transfers arrive the same day.
Keys to bank transfers: when are they executed, how long do they take?
Transfers under the new Payment Service law take only 1 business day, but what is considered a business day?"
758,€60 in Amazon check just for signing up for a free Wizink card,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/60e-en-cheque-amazon-solo-por-contratar-una-tarjeta-gratis-de-wizink/,25/10/2021,"Wizink has been giving away for several months to everyone who signs up the Me credit card, which is free, €60 in a welcome Amazon check and 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year).
It is an interesting offer, because it gives you that money to spend on Amazon without asking you for practically anything in return, just contract it and make the first use of the card once it is approved by the entity.
This is an exclusive offer for new customers and is valid as a first use for any purchase or cash withdrawal.
Once compliance is verified, the customer will receive via email or SMS in a few days with instructions to redeem the €60 Amazon.es gift voucher.
This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
759,How is the new Santander online account? No commissions and no ties?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/que-tal-es-la-nueva-cuenta-online-del-banco-santander/,21/10/2021,"Banco Santander's new online account, an account with no fees and no ties, has surprised many.
It is an account similar to the BBVA Online Account. We would really say that it is a copy to compete with them.
It is an account that if you look at its characteristics you will like it, but if you know or if you look at which bank it is from, chances are that you will not even read its characteristics.
What happens is that there are many, millions of people, who had Account 123 and in the end it has become a rubbish account, and no matter how much the bank has tried to back down, a large part of the former clients have taken it « disgust” (see here).
We always recommend that you look at the features and take advantage of the good offers.
Account 123, in the end was crap as we say, but you must remember that while it lasted, many people, among us, took advantage of that account, and when things got ugly, we left as we came in, but with a few euros more What we win.
Both accounts are practically a carbon copy. That is to say, Santander has copied BBVA's online account point by point and has launched it on the market in the hope of recovering some of its clients lost due to the (super demanding and super expensive) mistake of its Santander One Account.
The only difference is the ATMs, which each use their own. Choosing one or the other only depends on which ATMs are best for you.
Oh, BBVA has a friend plan that gives €15 for signing up through a friend's recommendation until December 31 (see here)


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

760,List and comparison of banks without commissions and without ties,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/lista-y-comparativa-de-bancos-sin-comisiones-y-sin-vinculaciones/,19/10/2021,"Banks are increasingly demanding more from their clients to exempt them from commissions. It's a competition to see who charges their clients the most (up to €240, see here).
Some (Santander) have already realized that this is NOT viable and have made some changes to their Account 123 (see here) and launched an Online Account without commissions and without links in the style of the BBVA Online account (see here) .
Like that account, there are more alternatives without commissions and conditions.
NOTE: we have eliminated Pibank from the list, because if this bank does not direct deposit a payroll, it does not give you a card nor does it allow direct deposit of receipts. It would be a Remunerated account at 0.30% APR, but it would only be a savings account and there would be many more, such as Renaultbank (0.30% APR).
If you read us from your mobile phone, put it in landscape mode to see the following table, it will look much better. Thank you.
Entities that allow cash withdrawals at all ATMs have limitations: number of times or require a minimum amount.
There are entities that only allow withdrawals at their own ATMs and others have agreements with a wide network of ATMs. Check our ATM traffic light (here).
We consider that it has offices, if it has enough. Not like ING or Evo Banco whose number is very small. Openbank only has one office of its own, but you have all the Santander offices to withdraw money for free.
Other entities that have offices, but require payment of commissions if you want to operate in them (cost).
We consider that it does have offices, although it requires certain conditions, such as Abanca, which allows you to withdraw cash for amounts that cannot be done at an ATM.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients and for an initial 12 months and is limited to €15,000.

In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Activo Bank has gone for years without any major news, and now it is because it seems that it is reaching the end of its life.
The entity reports on its website that its Active Account ""cannot be contracted temporarily."" Searching more online, the entity plans to migrate these clients to Banco Sabadell, in a new online account, in the style of BBVA or Banco Santander.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because they want to or because they are too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:"
761,These are the most popular online payment methods in Spain,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/estos-son-los-metodos-de-pago-online-mas-populares-en-espana/,19/10/2021,"The pandemic favored online commerce in Spain and more consumers are choosing some electronic means to make their purchases. Almost 80 percent of Spaniards say they buy online at least once a month; That is why more and more businesses are expanding their available payment gateways so that customers have more alternatives when making their purchases. These are the most popular online payment methods in Spain.
Credit and debit cards continue to be the favorites of Spaniards. MasterCard and Visa top the list of the most used. In the case of MasterCard, it is one of the most recognized brands worldwide that supports approximately 150 different currencies. In the case of Visa, this brand is, without a doubt, the most chosen by consumers, since it has a presence in almost 200 countries. When making online purchases, the banking entities that operate with the cards ask for user verification. This means that many consumers continue to trust this payment method.
Global payment platforms are those that operate around the world. Many of them link the user's cards and bank accounts and also operate through balance that users can use to make purchases. Currently, businesses that operate online, whether they are sports betting houses, travel agencies or streaming platforms, have these alternatives. Consumers choose them because they allow them to bring their financial products together in one place and use them without having to enter data every time they make a purchase. These are some of the most popular global payment platforms in Spain:
PaySafeCard
Understanding how PaySafeCard works is very simple. Unlike other platforms, it does not require linking financial products, instead users can purchase a preloaded card that has a 16-digit code or access a prepaid credit card. The main advantage of this payment method is that it is free and users can use it without even registering.
PayPal
PayPal is the most recognized international payment platform in the world. Its operation is also simple: the user creates an account, links the card to their bank account and can make payments with this product or use the balance they have available. As this method does not share the user's financial information, it is one of the most chosen by Spaniards.
neteller
Neteller works similar to the two previous alternatives and allows you to send and receive money online. However, this provider partners with Skrill, which is the payment platform designed exclusively for online casino and sportsbook payments. Spain is one of the countries that brings together the most players, so it is not surprising that this is one of the most chosen payment methods.
MasterCard, Visa, PaySafeCard, PayPal and Neteller are the most popular payment methods in Spain.

So that you can see the difference a little, Openbank currently also has its fundraising campaign active, but offering much more incentive.
Openbank gives you up to €600 depending on the amount of investment you make:
In this case, the bonus is a check from Amazon, but rather cash that the bank deposits into your bank account.
As we said, as the prize is greater, so is the permanence. In this case it is 1 year in the position in Investment Funds.
That year begins to count from January 14, 2022, both in the funds transferred during the campaign and in those already existing. Of course, the bank allows you to make internal transfers between the funds marketed by Openbank.
This promotion will be valid until December 15, 2021.
>> See promotion bases
Although Openbank's offer is more decent, we reiterate the same as always:
Invest in a fund, you do NOT have to look at the gift (it is just an addition). The important thing is to choose the right fund, any fluctuation in its value or even in the commissions that the bank may charge makes this gift insignificant.
The topics we discuss on our website/blogs are financial products for savers, however we have hundreds of articles where we have reference to Amazon checks, a gift card with which you can buy most of the things that this gigantic store sells. on-line.
Banks use this company as a hook to sell their products in exchange for giving you an AMAZON CHECK. In the past it was TVs, pans, pots...
In 2019, ING Spain and Portugal pocketed around 8 million euros in commissions for the passive management of its “Orange Investment +” strategy.
Be careful, the funds are very good, but they have their risks that you should know in advance. And be careful, there is FOGAIN, a guarantee fund, but it does not cover the losses of your investments, it only covers the bankruptcy of the fund manager.
Many savers have put their money in investment funds in recent years, because deposits offer practically no profitability.
Be careful, supervisors have warned in recent years about these products and their difference with deposits and now there is a new black swan lurking, the possible illiquidity of these products."
763,Can you buy everything with an Amazon check? That's what the banks think,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/con-un-cheque-amazon-se-compra-todo-eso-piensan-los-bancos/,14/10/2021,"The topics we discuss on our website/blogs are financial products for savers, however we have hundreds of articles where we have reference to Amazon checks, a gift card with which you can buy most of the things that this gigantic store sells. on-line.
Banks use this company as a hook to sell their products in exchange for giving you an AMAZON CHECK. It has been a trend in recent years, replacing the common gifts of before: TVs, Smartphones, microwaves, pans and casseroles (hahaha).
But it has been useful for everything (they are offers that have been in force, but currently, NO, except for the Wizink card):
But what we have never seen is that a bank offers a bonus of a paltry €25 in an Amazon check for hiring an investment fund.
In this sense, EBN Bank is communicating to its clients via email in which it indicates that if they make a contribution for a minimum total amount of €10,000 and before October 31, 2021, the bank will give you those €25 in an Amazon check.
This is a rubbish gift, because other entities (recent campaigns by BBVA, ING, Ibercaja or Unicaja Banco) normally offer between 1% and 5% bonus for the amount contributed. For €10,000 we are talking about €100 to €500.
The only good or semi-good thing about this offer is that the permanence requirement is low. Only until June 1, 2022. Other entities require years.
Finally add as we have always said. Invest in a fund, you do NOT have to look at the gift (it is just an addition). The important thing is to choose the right fund, any fluctuation in its value or even in the commissions that the bank may charge makes this gift insignificant.
Wizink continues in the month of October by giving new customers of the free Me credit card €60 in a welcome Amazon check and 3% in cashback (up to €72 per year).

764,You have 10 days left to renew your deposits in Pibank at 0.4% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/te-queda-10-dias-para-renovar-al-04-tae-tus-depositos-en-pibank/,13/10/2021,"Pibank cut the profitability of its deposits to 0.25% APR on September 23, but allows you to renew your deposits at the previous interest rate (0.4% APR) until October 22.
If this is your case, set a reminder and do it within 10 days if you intended to keep your money in Pibank.
It represents almost double the profitability that it offers to new deposits, although it is no longer as good as a few months ago.
In the month of May, the bank offered 0.8% APR, and now renewals are only half that, and new ones are not even a third.
The current characteristics of your deposit are:
The paid account that offers 0.3% APR, we believe, has its days numbered before it will be cut. It is not normal to offer more in an account than in a deposit.
In fact, Banco Pichincha already announces its remunerated account at 0.1% APR. Most likely, that will be the interest rate for this account soon.
The current conditions are:
The bank gives you 3 months to direct deposit any payroll or pension. If after this period you have not processed the direct debit, you will lose some of its advantages:
Internal transfers or transfers made by the account holder themselves are not considered payroll or pension.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."
765,Your payroll is worth money: up to 5 banks offer it to you in the month of October,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/tu-nomina-vale-dinero-hasta-5-bancos-te-lo-ofrecen-en-el-mes-de-octubre/,11/10/2021,"Yes, for banks, payroll is worth money, at least they spend it to get yours. In this month of October there are up to 5 offers that give up to €350 welcome bonus.
Of course, they will ask you, like mobile or internet companies, for a permanence and some other demands.
The Bank of Spain warned about this (see here), although we have always reminded you that you have to read the small print and accept its conditions.
Logically, if you do not comply, you will be penalized, but the cost never exceeds the benefits they provide, as long as you close the account when you no longer meet the conditions to not pay commissions.
Without further ado, we leave you the current list of offers:
Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you the €350 directly, but that they reward you all that money for leaving only €5,000 in the account for 2 years is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
Additionally, you can get another €50 if you sign up for the account via their Friend Plan (See here).
The offer is valid until December 31, 2021
Up to €300 for clients residing in certain communities (see here), €150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
It will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Cajamar gives €200 in cash if you direct a new payroll to the entity for the first time of at least €1,200 (If it were less, but greater than €950, it would give you €100).
Additionally, it requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.
The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021 or until 2,000 new direct debit payrolls are reached.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In exchange, it requires direct debit if you direct your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit of at least 900 euros.
It also offers €40 until September 30 in exchange for a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit that must be equal to or greater than €1,000, or equal to or greater than €600 if you are between 18 and 31 years old.
Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become customers, the bank will continue to continually offer you new promotions.
ING usually gives away €50 (NOT in force) if you open a payroll account and direct deposit a salary or pension into the account if you are invited by a friend and client of the bank, who will also take €50 (see more details here)
The advantages of the account are:
Furthermore, having the payroll account exempts you from paying commissions in the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

768,BFS is already under the Portuguese FGD and its deposits are even less profitable,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bfs-ya-esta-bajo-el-fgd-portugues-y-sus-depositos-son-aun-menos-rentables/,08/10/2021,"BFS deposits are already under the Portuguese FGD, but that does not mean that your money is remunerated more, quite the opposite.
Since the entity announced its role with its Portuguese parent BFT (Banco Finantial S.A.) and therefore its deposits were under the Portuguese FGD, the bank has lowered the profitability of its deposits.
This change was applied from October 1, 2021, yes, the bank of a BFT branch in Spain where clients residing in Spain have remained.
For practical purposes, there will be no big changes for Spanish clients, except for the FGD that will protect their money. It will move to the Portuguese FGD.
There will be no implications for personal income tax, you will NOT have to do form 720.
The money will continue to be in Spain (Spanish Branch) and will apply personal income tax withholdings that will be communicated to the Tax Agency. In the same way as ING.
Since the bank announced the change, the entity has lowered the profitability of all its deposits by 0.1 percentage points, with the current rates being:
The characteristics of these products are:
If you are a client and do not want to continue with BFS, you can leave at no cost and collect all the interest generated.
This is because it is a unilateral change of conditions by the bank, clients have the right to terminate the contract.
In this sense, the bank has informed clients that they have 3 months to make a decision from receipt of the communication:



BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
769,Abanca continues to give €300 (or €150) in exchange for payroll until December 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/abanca-sigue-dando-300e-o-150e-a-cambio-de-nomina-hasta-diciembre-de-2021/,07/10/2021,"Abanca extends its offer of up to €300 until December 31 in exchange for the direct debit of a payroll or pension.
This offer lasted until September 31, and the bank has extended it for 3 months, until the end of the year.
The €300 is only for those who reside in Madrid or Asturias, if you are in another community, it will only give you half, €150.
Is this difference justified? We understand that the bank has different targets or objectives depending on the autonomous communities. However, many of our users consider it discrimination.
This ""discrimination"" is not so much if we compare it with the Deutsche Bank offer that was in force at the beginning of 2021, which excluded foreigners and those not born in Spain (see here).
The bank's requirements are:
For more information, call 91 090 07 97.
The account allows up to 2 holders with the following advantages:

770,"EBN allows its clients to renew their deposits without ties, only up to 0.6% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/ebn-permite-a-sus-clientes-renovar-sus-depositos-sin-vinculaciones-solo-hasta-el-06-tae/,06/10/2021,"EBN suspended the marketing of all its deposits almost 1 year ago, but its clients have been able to renew their deposits since then.
However, these clients will be in for a surprise if they want to renew their deposits now, profitability is a shadow of what it was.
Already in February 2021 the entity made a good cut in the remuneration of these products, currently it is even worse.
Regarding your paid account, it remains unchanged, at 0.15% APR, the interest rate established in the month of May 2021.
Their deposits were characterized by their high profitability, their impossibility of early cancellation and the possibility of being canceled by the bank (see here).
The rest of the features are:
New customers can continue to subscribe to their savings account at 0.15% APR, the interest rate set in May 2021.
The account characteristics are:
Its contract is automatic if you make a deposit in the bank, or you can exclusively contract the account here.
It is one of the most profitable accounts on the market surpassed only by a handful of entities (see here)
Yes, EBN has included this possibility in the pre-contractual information (see here), in the Other information section:

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. As we have told you, it is the first deposit that we see this clause.


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
771,"The most profitable savings accounts of October 2021, up to 1% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/las-cuentas-de-ahorro-mas-rentables-de-octubre-2021-hasta-el-1-tae/,05/10/2021,"If you are looking for profitability in a savings product, right now you have to go, strangely, to a savings account.
Normally banks reward profitability when you take out a long-term deposit, but that does not happen now. Banks DO NOT want to guarantee profitability for a long time.
In any case, financial institutions are also cutting the remuneration of these products month after month.
The latest and most important changes are:
The most profitable accounts on the market in force this October are:
*OrangeBank will give 0.5% APR for a maximum of €40,000 from December 1, 2021
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Renault Bank will continue to pay 0.5% APR to customers prior to November 30, 2021
The most prominent accounts are those of Orange Bank and MyInvestor, but not as much as it was before.
Now MyInvestor only gives 1% APR for 1 year and Orange Bank will only give 0.5% APR, yes, for €40,000 and for an indefinite period.
Pibank's 0.3% APR account runs some risk of an upcoming reduction. The entity has never offered more profitability in its account than in its deposits, which is currently the case.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
772,Bankinter continues to give 5% APR (since 2012) and €50 for the friend plan,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bankinter-sigue-dando-un-5-tae-desde-2012-y-50e-por-el-plan-amigo/,04/10/2021,"Deposits and interest-bearing accounts have plummeted in recent years. It has been falling for almost 10 years, since the end of 2012 when it reached the maximum rates.
However, there is one account that has not changed since then, it is the Bankinter Payroll Account that has been offering that 5% APR since then.
In reality, we are not telling the whole truth, it has changed, but for the better, now you can get that 5% without even directing your payroll.
In addition, it now offers a friend plan that gives you another €50 extra if you sign up as the help of a friend who is a customer of the bank.
Until December 31, 2021, Bankinter offers its offer to remunerate you at 5% APR during the first year, and a second year at 2% APR for the money you deposit in the Payroll Account.
But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000 (young Bk, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
Bankinter has the friend plan in force until December 31, 2021 applicable to the contracting of a Payroll Account (from €800 in payroll) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 in payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below.
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until December 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).
>> See promotion bases
The total bonus for both promotions would be €400 gross (€260 in the case of Bk Young) or €324 net (after paying taxes) for the new customer. The bank spends €450 for each payroll.
Be careful, only the Payroll Account is worth it. If you do not have a payroll, you will only be able to get €350 in interest.
It is a good offer and a good alternative to attract those dissatisfied with the latest changes at BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Bankia or even Banco Sabadell.
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:
This offer will be available until December 31, 2021. Offer valid until 40,000 new accounts are contracted in the case of the Payroll Account, and 5,000 in the case of the Non-Payroll Account.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."
773,OrangeBank once again offers €20 for opening an account and using its card,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orangebank-vuelve-a-ofrecer-20e-por-abrir-cuenta-y-usar-la-tarjeta/,01/10/2021,"Orange Bank once again offers bonuses to new customers and the use of cards.
On this occasion, it will give €20 to new customers who open their savings account, deposit money for the first time and use the debit card up to 15 times.
The offer starts today, October 1, 2021, and will last until January 31, 2022. The catch is that it will only be for customers with an Orange mobile contract line.
The way to get a bonus is as follows:
These users will have 30 days from when they become customers to get the €20 bonus.
Orange Bank deposits you immediately into your account every time you perform any of the above actions, although its website indicates that it may take up to 30 days.
As of December 1, 2021, Orange Bank will reduce the profitability of your account by half, to 0.5% APR, but will increase the limit of remunerated money by double, up to €40,000 (previously €20,000).
The end result is that you will pay a maximum of the same amount in interest to your clients, but they have to leave twice as much money.
The characteristics of the account will be as of December 1:
The bank will offer services through a mobile application, from which you can carry out banking operations:
In addition, the application offers a chat from which the customer can interact with bank agents who will offer the help they need.
Orange customers can register with Orange Bank online through its website (orangebank.es) or in the company's own stores.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.
The topics we discuss on our website/blogs are financial products for savers, however we have hundreds of articles where we have reference to Amazon checks, a gift card with which you can buy most of the things that this gigantic store sells. on-line.

The previous time was in the month of July when it established the interest rate of 0.5% APR that current clients will continue to enjoy until November 30.
From that date they will go to 0.3% APR like the new accounts that are contracted from today.
Yesterday the entity issued a statement to its clients in which they only informed them of this decrease, without giving any explanation (see below).

Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
The entity maintains the Tú Deposit unchanged, which remains at 0.5% APR
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.



Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."

But be careful, it is not an offer open to all clients, but it is only available to clients selected in the commercial action of “Offer Payroll Direct Debit” available in the offices of the Cajamar Cooperative Group Entities.
Furthermore, to get the €200 you need a salary of at least €1,200. If you don't reach it, but at least exceed €950, you will receive a bonus of €100.
The entity additionally requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In case of non-compliance, the bank will penalize you depending on when you remove the payroll:
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.
The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021 or until 2,000 new direct debit payrolls are reached (period between January and December 2021).
The bonus is deposited into the customer account when it is verified that the first payroll has been deposited.
The client does not actually receive the €200, because it is subject to withholding and at the client's expense. What you will actually charge will be €162 net.
To benefit from this offer you have to go to one of their offices.

Cajamar continues to offer its liquidity raising deposit, called Depósito Hola, at a decent profitability of 3.03% APR and a term of 12 months.
If you already have the money in the bank, the entity offers a 2% APR and also a 12-month duration.
In addition, it has an account paid at 2.52% APR, but only for balances of €6,000 to €12,000.
Cajamar offers a liquidity raising deposit, called Depósito Hola, at a decent profitability of 3.03% APR and a term of 12 months.
It is far from the best offers, but it is an interesting option for bank clients who do not want to leave the bank.
Several financial entities that offer money, up to €350, in exchange for your salary, and end their promotional campaign at the end of March.
But some, like Bankinter, have already renewed their offer and extended it until the end of June."
777,The best payroll capture offers from banks for September 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-mejores-ofertas-de-captacion-de-nomina-de-los-bancos-de-septiembre/,28/09/2021,"During the month of September, many banks continue trying to capture payroll from their clients by even offering them up to €350 as a welcome bonus.
The Bank of Spain (BdE) warned about these payroll raising offers (see here), but are they really bad or dangerous?
We don't believe it, you must read the fine print and accept its conditions.
Logically, if you do not comply, you will be penalized, but the cost never exceeds the benefits they provide, as long as you close the account when you no longer meet the conditions to not pay commissions.
Without further ado, we leave you the current list of offers:
Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you the €350 directly, but that they reward you all that money for leaving only €5,000 in the account for 2 years is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
Additionally, you can get another €50 if you sign up for the account via their Friend Plan (See here).
The offer is valid until December 31, 2021
Up to €300 for clients residing in certain communities (see here), €150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
It will be valid until September 30.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In exchange, it requires direct debit if you direct your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit of at least 900 euros.
It also offers €40 until September 30 in exchange for a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit that must be equal to or greater than €1,000, or equal to or greater than €600 if you are between 18 and 31 years old.
Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become customers, the bank will continue to continually offer you new promotions.
ING usually gives away €50 (NOT in force) if you open a payroll account and direct deposit a salary or pension into the account if you are invited by a friend and client of the bank, who will also take €50 (see more details here)
The advantages of the account are:
Furthermore, having the payroll account exempts you from paying commissions in the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
778,The busy path of Bitcoin in post-pandemic times,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/el-movido-camino-del-bitcoin-en-tiempos-post-pandemia/,28/09/2021,"It has been encouraging to witness the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, especially over the past few years. While the rich and famous were among the first to trade Bitcoin, now anyone can do so using one of the several Bitcoin trading apps available. Despite the difficulties in predicting Bitcoin trends, people interested in the cryptocurrency remain optimistic. We will look at some of the many benefits of investing in Bitcoin in this article.
If you've been following the news recently, you'll know that Bitcoin adoption has been growing rapidly among several well-known firms that have openly endorsed the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, since 2019, the number of users who have used the Blockchain wallet has steadily increased. Bitcoin's rapid consumer adoption indicates that the cryptocurrency's popularity is unlikely to wane very soon in the euro markets.
According to estimates, the number of investors purchasing Bitcoin using services such as PayPal and Cash App is constantly increasing. In reality, the company's Bitcoin revenue has exceeded $1.6 billion. In a recent study, it was revealed that its gross profit for the third quarter of 2020 was approximately $30 million. Visit the blockchain to learn more about bitcoin trading.
Another reason to buy Bitcoin in 2021 is that it adapts well to the macroeconomic climate. It is worth noting that the cryptocurrency was created out of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Bitcoin was introduced to the world in a period of government and bank bailouts, and prospered despite being ignored by the general public in its early days. Years later, the world is going through another crisis, with several nations going through bailouts and other difficulties.
It is easy to understand the unique value proposition that Bitcoin has to offer during these times of crisis and the increasing popularity of Bitcoin. It is also good to highlight the inclusion of bitcoin as legal currency within the territory of El Salvador in September 2021.
The notion of “Stock to Flow” is wonderful and has been floating around the financial world. This approach can be used to calculate the precise shortage of a product.
The good news is that the cryptocurrency has always managed to rise, and its latest price surge is proof of Bitcoin's success. Other dangers are more personal; For example, if your hard drive crashes, you can lose your entire Bitcoin treasure in a matter of seconds; Aside from that, hacking events are not unknown, which increases the risk of investing in crypto. The good news is that there are several app trading bots that allow you to safely trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Although China's government attack on cryptocurrencies exacerbated the price decline, Bitcoin's decline in May and June had nothing to do with fundamentals. However, the final price depreciation was purely speculative. Likewise, the cryptocurrency's recent rally is due to market volatility. When you take a step back, the investment thesis for Bitcoin hasn't changed much since its first fall in May.
Track regulatory changes, institutional moves like PayPal's plan to enable crypto trading for its UK customers, and other news that contributes to the long-term growth story for Bitcoin investors. Bitcoin's success in the coming decades will ultimately be determined by its stickiness in global financial markets. If that's something an investor believes in, there are good reasons to invest in Bitcoin, even if the price is $50,000.
Maybe you're wondering how blockchain technology could revolutionize supply chains? Here's how this technology could help revolutionize supply chains.
Perhaps you are wondering what qualities make Bitcoin considered money? Here's a guide to what makes this digital money so valuable.
Maybe you're wondering why the Bitcoin market is about to explode? Here's why the Bitcoin market will likely adopt this trend."
779,In 1 week your money in BFS will be under the Portuguese FGD,https://www.tucapital.es/bancos/fgd-fondo-de-garantia-de-depositos/en-1-semana-tu-dinero-en-bfs-estara-bajo-el-fgd-portugues/,24/09/2021,"BFS (Banco Finantial Spain) plans to merge with its Portuguese parent BFT (Banco Finantial S.A.) and if you have deposits, your money will be under the protection of the Portuguese FGD.
This change will be applied within 1 week, starting on October 1, 2021 according to the bank's forecast and if the operation is authorized by the competent authorities.
For practical purposes, there will be no big changes for Spanish clients, except for the FGD that will protect their money. It will move to the Portuguese FGD.
There will be no implications for personal income tax, you will NOT have to do form 720.
The money will continue to be in Spain (Spanish Branch) and will apply personal income tax withholdings that will be communicated to the Tax Agency. In the same way as ING.
Given that it is a unilateral change of conditions by the bank, clients have the right to terminate the contract, charging all interest until that moment and without applying the early cancellation conditions and any costs.
In this sense, the bank has informed clients, who have 3 months to make a decision from receipt of the communication (around July 22):

The Portuguese bank has recently cut the profitability of all its deposits by 0.1 percentage points:
The characteristics of these products are:
BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
780,"Pibank lowers your deposit to 0.25% APR, 0.3% of your paid account is in danger",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/pibank-baja-hasta-02-tae-su-deposito-en-peligro-el-03-de-su-cuenta-remunerada/,23/09/2021,"Pibank cuts the profitability of its deposit from 0.4% APR to 0.25% APR. This is announced on its website and in a communication to its clients.
In the statement, it indicates to current clients that the deposit ""will have an interest rate of 0.25% APR for renewals of deposits maturing on or after October 23, 2021 (inclusive).""
That is, they have 1 more month to renew the deposit at 0.4% APR.
The new interest rate of 0.25% APR is applied to new deposits starting today, September 23.
A few months ago, the entity went from offering its deposit at 0.8% APR, in May, to the current 0.25% APR; to the third part.
The current characteristics of your deposit are:
The paid account that offers 0.3% APR, we believe, has its days numbered before it will be cut. It is not normal to offer more in an account than in a deposit.
In fact, Banco Pichincha already announces its remunerated account at 0.1% APR. Most likely, that will be the interest rate for this account soon.
The current conditions are:
The bank gives you 3 months to direct deposit any payroll or pension. If after this period you have not processed the direct debit, you will lose some of its advantages:
Internal transfers or transfers made by the account holder themselves are not considered payroll or pension.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."
781,Comparison Online Account without commissions/conditions BBVA vs Santander,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/comparativa-cuenta-online-sin-comisiones-condiciones-bbva-vs-santander/,22/09/2021,"Both BBVA, which has been around for a long time, and the recently launched Santander, market an online account without commissions and without conditions.
A strange product for 2 banks that demand a lot or charge many commissions from their clients.
Both accounts are practically a carbon copy. That is to say, Santander has copied BBVA's online account point by point and has launched it on the market in the hope of recovering some of its clients lost due to the (super demanding and super expensive) mistake of its Santander One Account.
The only difference is the ATMs, which each use their own. Choosing one or the other only depends on which ATMs are best for you.
Oh, BBVA has a friend plan that gives €15 for signing up through a friend's recommendation until December 31 (see here)


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
782,"Banco Big, one of the few banks that continue to give deposits at 1% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/banco-big-uno-de-los-pocos-bancos-que-siguen-dando-un-1-tae/,21/09/2021,"Banco Big is one of the few banks that continue to offer a deposit at 1% APR. This is a welcome deposit, the “Big Deposit” for new clients and rewards up to a maximum investment of €50,000.
This offer has not been changed since its launch in Spain in October 2020, so it will soon be its anniversary.
The worst part of this product, along with the fact that it can only be contracted once, is its term, 3 months, a bit short of time. Too little.
The features are:
With this product a new client can get €125 gross interest during the 3 months if they deposit €50,000.
The entity currently offers 3 deposits:
It has the same characteristics as the welcome deposit, except that the maximum investment limit is €250,000.
Big offers the “Big Account”, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:
Big is a Portuguese entity with a Portuguese bank account and a branch in Spain (Spanish IBAN and personal income tax withholdings in Spain). Therefore, it is covered by the Portuguese FGD: €100,000 per person and client.
Do you remember BES? The Banco Espirito Santo that offered super-profitable deposits a few years ago? Well, Big will work the same.
Regarding his solvency, there is not much data.
According to the latest audited data, the entity has a total of 2,277 million net assets, 347.1 million of its own capital and assets under supervision worth 3,401 million euros.
In 2018 they earned 23 million euros.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
783,Santander launches an online account without commissions and without conditions in the style of BBVA,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/santander-saca-una-cuenta-online-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condiciones-al-estilo-de-bbva/,20/09/2021,"How many clients will Banco Santander have lost by eliminating Account 123 and removing its Santander One!
In the month of July, after less than 6 months since the implementation of Santander One, the entity rectified and softened the conditions for no commissions in its Santander One account (see here) leaving it practically as it was in Account 123.
Now, the entity takes out an account WITHOUT COMMISSIONS and WITHOUT CONDITIONS in the style of the BBVA online account.
The downside is that no one trusts Santander and its continuous changes in conditions, and oh, just like BBVA requires that you be a new client of the bank.
The conditions at first seem very decent:
We will try to open the account having been a client of the bank with Account 123 and we unsubscribed in 2020. We will see what they tell us and we will tell you.
During these almost 6 months the bank established 3 groups of relationships:
1. Income and payment links:
2. Product Links
3. Shareholders (1,000 bank shares)
Depending on the links, the following commissions were charged.
The bank establishes 3 possibilities:
Fulfilling one of the 2:
In short, the basic services that people usually have: payroll, receipts and cards were not enough.
The new commissions will be €20 per month, and will be exempt if one of the following conditions is met:
You would get a discount of €10 per month if the client meets one of the following conditions:
It would be like a return to Account 123.

784,"Renault Bank is NOT “updating” its system. It's a bug, how to solve it?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/renault-bank-no-esta-actualizando-su-sistema-es-un-fallo-como-solucionarlo/,20/09/2021,"We are not the first to have problems with Renault Bank accessing its website. Apparently it is something generalized and it is not that the bank is updating its system as indicated, it is a generic message when there is a failure.
Last Thursday we registered with Renault Bank and on Friday we already had the keys, and we wanted to start operating, but it was impossible. Every time we tried to log in it told us that the bank is updating its system.
But today, it is still the same and we are already trying to find out what was happening and following the instructions of one of our users who wrote to us this weekend following Friday's post.
We contacted them via chat. First of all, a machine gives us an automatic response. We told him that it was not the solution to our problem and he put us through to an operator:
And finally we enter the account.
Some users have described similar situations to us:
Good morning,
As a regular reader of your page, I am writing to you today regarding the entry you published yesterday about Renault Bank.
I have been a customer of this bank for a few months, and I want to confirm that the operation is horrible, totally and absolutely chaotic. The message that appears, indicating that they are carrying out maintenance work, is not new, and it is not even true.
It is a message that appears continuously when access is blocked, in my case it happens 90% of the times I try to access. Through the app I have never been able to access it, and in fact the comments about the app indicate the same, so it is not my particular problem.
Through the website it was easier to access, although that “maintenance” message often appears. And it continues to appear indefinitely until you call the customer service number and they unlock it for you and at the same time they make you change the password. Until the next time it crashes, which will be in a few days.
They say they are opening an incident and that they will call you to resolve it. In my case, I have had two open for months and they have never called me.
The last time was already hilarious. When you talk to them on the phone, they generate a password that they send to your mobile, you access it and they ask you to change it for a new one with very uncomfortable criteria to meet (it cannot have more than 4 letters or numbers in a row). You do it, but it still doesn't work. So they open an incident that is never resolved…
I continued for several days afterwards trying to access it, with the new password that had been generated for me. It allowed you the first access, asked you to change the password and it was blocked again. Until, don't ask me how, suddenly one day he lets me log in with my first password!
I took the opportunity to withdraw all the money, and I never want to hear about Renault Bank again. Malfunctions, poor customer service and, for me, serious danger of your money being blocked, or God knows what...
Thank you very much as always for the great work you do and greetings.
Many more people are saying that this bank is not worth the problems. The entity should get its act together and fix all these technical failures.
Customers have complained quite a bit about the registration process and customer service when they have these problems.
In the month of February we already reported another similar problem (see here).
In addition, they are not very strict on the date of interest payment. As far as we know, it has already been delayed twice. The last time, in the month of June (see here).
This entity is not new to us. Until now we have known it as RCI Banque, a French entity whose deposits could be contracted in Spain.
With this launch, the bank was supposed to facilitate the contracting of its products: a website in Spanish and specific products for our country, but things are becoming more complicated.
Another point in favor is that opening a branch in Spain saves us from having to deal with the Treasury. This bank will apply personal income tax withholdings, it will operate like ING in Spain, only the FGD is French.
The bank offers 2 products whose profitability has been decreasing since it existed.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.

Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
786,"""Orange Bank is getting bigger"": it wants to capture your payroll and lower your profitability",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-se-hace-mayor-quiere-captar-tu-nomina-y-bajarte-la-rentabilidad/,16/09/2021,"Orange Bank has sent a statement to customers saying that “it is getting older” and informs you that it will allow you to direct deposit your payroll and will cut your interest rate by half.
That is what happens with almost all banks when they have been established for a while and have attracted a sufficient mass of clients: they capture your income and make you more profitable for the bank and less profitable for you, lowering your remuneration.
But the news we expected does not arrive and it is the main impediment for many not to take the step and open an account at Orange Bank and it is that it is not known when they will eliminate the requirement of having an Orange number to be a customer of the bank.
The entity indicated at the beginning of 2021 that this possibility would be opened by the end of the year, but at the moment there is no news.
Oh, and when the bank says that it allows direct deposit of the payroll, it means that it only allows one payroll and it will be from December 1, 2021, but no pensions or unemployment benefits. He says they are working on it.
In the second part of the statement, it was something that we already knew, that the entity is going to cut the interest rate on its account from 1% APR to 0.5% APR (see here)
Hello, XXXX!
It's been almost two years since we launched Orange Bank and we are no longer the newborn project we were at the beginning. We now have more than 125,000 clients and an increasingly broad banking offering.
The time has come to make several important decisions that will take effect on December 1, 2021:
· First the good news: From now on you will be able to direct your payroll to Orange Bank. You've been asking us for it for a long time and here it is. You will not yet be able to use your Orange Bank Account to direct deposit benefits and pensions from public organizations, but we are working on it.
· And now the not so good ones, because growing up means, sometimes, giving up things that we like: The remuneration of your Savings Account will go from the current 1% APR to 0.5% APR. We know that it is a bucket of cold water, but to make it less harsh, we are going to increase the maximum paid balance from the current €20,000 to €40,000. What will not change is that the settlements will continue to be monthly, and that you will be able to enjoy the rest of the products and services of the Orange Bank Account as always.
For this reason, we are going to update your contract, which, by the way, we have reviewed, renumbered and written in a more understandable way (we hope you like it). In addition, we have taken the opportunity to make other changes:
· Clause 2.2 of the particular conditions in relation to the remuneration of the Savings Account has been modified, and has been moved to clause 2.1.
· Clause 5.1.4 of the general conditions has been modified and the new wording is included in clauses 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 to include the new payroll direct debit service.
· The Current Account overdraft cases have been modified in the general conditions, clause 7.7 is now 8.7 and 6.8 has been included.
· Clause 2.3 of the particular conditions in relation to expenses for claiming debtor positions has been modified to adjust it to the new regulation and has been moved to clause 2.2.
· Clause 23 of the general conditions on Data Protection has been modified.
You can consult all these contractual modifications by clicking here, or in the contract that you will find in the “Documentation” section in the “Client area” section of the app.
If you do not agree with these changes, you can, as always, cancel your Orange Bank Account at no additional cost to you before they come into force on December 1, 2021. If you do not do so, we consider that you accept the modification of the contract.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
787,"For Abanca, the payroll has a different value if you live in Madrid or Asturias: €300 vs €150",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/para-abanca-la-nomina-tiene-diferente-valor-si-vives-en-madrid-o-asturias-300e-vs-150e/,15/09/2021,"Abanca offers until September 30 €300 in exchange for direct debit of a payroll if you live in Madrid or Asturias, but it will only be €150 if you live in other autonomous communities.
We can understand that the target or objective of the bank is to attract more clients in some communities compared to others, but many of our users consider this discrimination.
This ""discrimination"" is not so much if we compare it with the Deutsche Bank offer that was in force at the beginning of 2021, which excluded foreigners and those not born in Spain (see here).
The bank's requirements are:
For more information, call 91 090 07 97.
The account allows up to 2 holders with the following advantages:
If you want a credit card, it will be free for the first year.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
788,Comparison Orange Bank vs MyInvestor after the Orange Bank snip,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/comparativa-orange-bank-vs-myinvestor-tras-el-tijeretazo-de-orange-bank/,14/09/2021,"Both entities had been offering their savings accounts at 1% APR for an indefinite period.
But not long ago, MyInvestor made a change that affects former customers and now, Orange Bank will apply a snip to all its accounts starting December 1, 2021. Which offer will be better?
The 2 banks continue without asking anything in return from their clients to offer them an account with a profitability above the market and with all services at no cost.
MyInvestor stopped offering its 1% APR indefinitely and only gives that return during the first year. Former customers receive only 0.1% APR. The bank leaves the maximum remunerated limit of money unchanged: €15,000
The Orange Bank change that will take effect from December 1, 2021 will be a reduction of that 1% APR to 0.5% APR. Of course, at 0.5% APR, it pays twice as much money as before, up to €40,000.
During the first year of being a customer, MyInvestor is undoubtedly better, paying twice as much as Orange Bank.
But from the second year onwards, Orange Bank is better by offering you 0.5% APR compared to MyInvestor's 0.1% APR.
Orange Bank rewards a larger amount of money (up to €40,000), while MyInvestor is only €15,000.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
Of course, you must take advantage of MyInvestor's initial promotion wisely.
If you have €15,000 or less (preferably very close to €15,000), hire MyInvestor and take advantage of that 1% APR during the first year, then switch to Orange Bank.
If you have more than €15,000, put the €15,000 in MyInvestor and the rest in Orange Bank or other alternatives that we indicate below.
After the changes, they are no longer the accounts that were undoubtedly better compared to the rest of the accounts. Now Renault Bank also enters the scene.
*OrangeBank continues at 1.0% APR for a maximum of €20,000 until November 30, 2021
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
789,"The 1% APR bargain at Orange Bank will end from December 2021, snip",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/se-acabara-el-chollo-del-1-tae-en-orange-bank-a-partir-de-diciembre-de-2021-tijeretazo/,13/09/2021,"Orange Bank announces on its website that as of December 1, 2021, your account will be remunerated at 0.5% APR (previously 1% APR), half as much as now, but the limit of remunerated money will double, up to 40,000 € (before €20,000).
The end result is that you will pay a maximum of the same amount in interest to your clients, but they have to leave twice as much money.
Here those banks like ING (see here) or BBVA (see here) that charge commissions to their clients for leaving their money in their accounts and justify it because having their clients' money costs them would have something to say.
The entity launched its product, which has been one of the best paid accounts on the market, in November 2019 and will now make a change for the first time and it will be a cut that seems a little exaggerated to us by lowering it to half.
In any case, we believe that this decision is better for savers than MyInvestor, which left 1% APR only for the first year of new clients and the rest at 0.1% APR (see here).
The characteristics of the account will be as of December 1:
The bank will offer services through a mobile application, from which you can carry out banking operations:
In addition, the application offers a chat from which the customer can interact with bank agents who will offer the help they need.
Orange customers can register with Orange Bank online through its website (orangebank.es) or in the company's own stores.
*OrangeBank will give 0.5% APR for a maximum of €40,000 from December 1, 2021
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
It is necessary to be an Orange customer to register with OrangeBank, which is of little concern because there is a free way (see here).
The bank confirmed that there are no problems (see here)


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.

The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
790,"Customers of the Bankia On Account, Caixa Bank will also charge you €36 for the debit card",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/clientes-de-la-cuenta-on-de-bankia-caixa-bank-te-cobrar-36e-por-la-tarjeta-de-debito/,10/09/2021,"As we said a few days ago, Caixa Bank will eliminate the Bankia On Account and all its conditions and they will be transferred to the Day to Day Account with payment of up to €240 commission if you do not join (see here).
But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year.
If you want to continue with Caixa Bank (we don't understand your reasons), you will have to cancel the debit card and sign up for a credit card (MyCard) associated with the Day by Day account, which is free.
This commission will begin to apply from January 1, 2022.
In this sense, the bank is informing former Bankia clients that as of November 12, their card contracts will be transferred to the bank resulting from the merger.
Of course, clients who meet the requirements of the plan in the month of October: direct deposit of payroll and take out insurance, investment fund or use the credit card twice a month, will continue with the debit card for free, and until June 2022.
>> See statement
From October 1, 2020, CaixaBank required compliance with the following 2 conditions:

If you only meet the first condition, the bank will charge you €15 in commission quarterly (€60 per year).
If you do not meet any of the conditions, the commission amounts to €60 per quarter (€240 per year).
Oh, and be careful, you can only operate through their digital channels or at ATMs, since if you do it in their offices, they will charge you 2 euros per operation (Those over 65 years of age can carry out 4 free operations per month).
Of course, you get rid of commissions if you have one of the following accounts:
Oh, it also offers a free account to holders under 26 and new customers for the first year.
NOTE: The products to take into account for the €20,000 are: investment funds, fund portfolios, structured funds, managed portfolios, savings insurance and individual pension plans.
There are many, even in the bank itself and its ImaginBank account, all free and without ties.
Yesterday we published up to 11 alternatives and some with many advantages (see here)


CaixaBank will carry out the technological integration with Bankia between Friday, November 12, and Sunday, November 14, 2021.
There will also be more commissions for Bankia customers: for the card and for the On Account
CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022.
Last Friday, Bankia merged with CaixaBank, with the CaixaBank name prevailing due to its prestige unlike Bankia.
But this predominance goes beyond its simple name, also in terms of marketing and product policy.
At the moment, Bankia's On Account, its most interesting account, has fallen"

Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card defaults to full payment at the end of the month, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.

792,11 alternatives without links and without commissions for clients of the Caixa Bank On Account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/11-alternativas-sin-vinculaciones-y-sin-comisiones-para-clientes-de-la-cuenta-on-de-caixa-bank/,08/09/2021,"CaixaBank will give Bankia's online customers a good blow by requiring them to comply with the Day by Day program to be exempt from commissions (up to €240 per year).
From not having to comply with anything at all, to having to direct deposit the income in addition to receipts or use your cards to continue at no cost.
The solution is easy and the most damage is done to the bank is to request the cancellation of the account or better yet, make a portability to another entity (see here): You go to the bank where you want to go, tell them everything you want to contract and bring and they take care of everything.
There are many entities that continue to offer everything for free without asking for anything in return, which are the ones we are going to talk about here. If you want to join, there are banks that give you up to €350 (read here).
Without further ado, we leave you the list of all these banks. But if you want you can see here the comparative table of all these banks: their advantages and their services.
It offers everything for free in exchange for nothing (account, transfers, card, all ATMs 3 times a month), and is one of the few that offers free immediate transfers and also free Bizum.
In addition, it remunerates your money very well, at 1% APR for the first €20,000.
The buts:
Perhaps with these buts, many would remove it from this list and we would agree with them, but that 1% APR...
Give everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers, and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It does not have immediate transfers, but it does have transfers on the day (before 12:00)
In addition, your money is remunerated at 1% APR for the first €15,000, yes, now only for the first 12 months. Then at 0.1% APR.
This entity, paradoxically part of the Santander group, offers its checking account with everything free (account, debit card, normal transfers, Bizum, and all Banco Santander ATMs can withdraw money) in exchange for nothing.
It is one of the few entities that allows you to go to an office (Santander) to withdraw cash (in addition to Santander ATMs) at no cost.
In addition, they periodically launch a campaign that gives you around €40 as a welcome gift (you have until December 17 to take advantage of this promo, see here).
And if you have a payroll, it offers you a greater bonus:
You can sign up for the account first (€40 bonus) and then domiciliate the payroll (you choose between a 5% account or a welcome bonus). This way, you get both promotions.
The entity offers a savings account that pays up to 0.2% APR (with payroll) or, if not, at a ridiculous interest of 0.05% APR.
A few months ago he made his account free for everyone, without any requirements (see here)
Its great advantages, in addition to no commissions and no ties, are:
The downside is that it has very few offices (but there are more than practically the rest of the banks that, even if they have offices, do not allow you to go unless you pay).
This is another entity that gives you everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It also has the friend plan in which you can take up to €150 depending on the links you contract.
The Banco Sabadell online bank offers a free account and debit card with free cash withdrawals at a wide network of ATMs.
It seems unbelievable, but yes, BBVA has an account without commissions and without ties. It is the Online Account.
Of course, it is only for new customers. We former clients know that they have been able to contract it, but they have to pay for the cards.
CaixaBank's online bank (yes, CaixaBank), without commissions and without ties.
It offers the typical: account, cards, transfers and free bizum.
It is the most recommended entity and generates great trust among its clients. It also offers its Payroll Account for people who do not have a payroll. In exchange, it requires monthly income of at least €700 from another entity.
You will have an account, card and normal transfers at no cost, and you will be able to withdraw cash at a wide range of ATMs and even stores with your Twyp APP.
Additionally, if you have a payroll, the entity usually has the Amigo Plan, in which it gives you €50 (currently not in force).
It has the Orange account which is remunerated, but even more ridiculous than Openbank, at 0.01% APR.
We said about OrangeBank that it had the but of the FGD, here we would say the same: it is Dutch (we repeat, for many it is not a but but rather an advantage).
BE CAREFUL that ING recently requires a condition or will charge a commission on your Orange account if you do not have a payroll account (see here).
Bankinter also offers you an account without commissions, and without the need for payroll, but requires links:
And if you have a payroll, much easier:
The prize is not bad at all. Plus everything free. It pays you well during the first 2 years and for a maximum of €5,000
In total there are €350 of interest that the account can generate.
If you want an account without fees, cards, transfers and withdraw cash at any ATM in the world for free, you have to direct deposit a payroll or pension into Pibank.
If you don't do it, you will only have a paid account, although quite well paid, at 0.5% APR.
Accounts proposed by our readers that we add here because they are also interesting:
Abanca Clara Account: No demands and with everything free, included, transfers and Bizum. Additionally, if you domiciliate the payroll before February 28, 2021, it gives you €150.
Cajamar Wefferente Account: No demands and no commissions and as a great advantage you can withdraw cash from €50 for free at any ATM.
N26 Account: It has a Spanish Iban that does not charge you for anything and does not ask you for anything.
This time we are going to get wet and choose, but we would not choose just one bank, but several or all:
And you? Leave us a comment.

The large banks have resisted, but finally, one of them, Caixa Bank, takes the step and begins to offer a ""somewhat decent"" return on savings: A 12-month deposit at 2% APR.
It is nothing extraordinary, since if we compare it with the best offers, it is half of what they offer and it also comes with a catch.
CaixaBank will carry out the technological integration with Bankia between Friday, November 12, and Sunday, November 14, 2021.
There will also be more commissions for Bankia customers: for the card and for the On Account
As we said a few days ago, Caixa Bank will eliminate the Bankia On Account and all its conditions and they will be transferred to the Day to Day Account with payment of up to €240 commission if you do not join (see here).
But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year."
793,Avoid CaixaBank if you have the Bankia On Account. Up to €240 commission per year,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/huye-de-caixabank-si-tienes-la-cuenta-on-de-bankia-hasta240e-de-comision-al-ano/,07/09/2021,"CaixaBank permanently eliminates the free online Bankia account, the On Account, and will convert it into the Day to Day Account that will require links if you do not want to pay commissions.
In this sense, the bank has communicated this to its clients and it will come into force on November 12, 2021, with a period of just over 2 months as established.
The change is brutal. If you do nothing about it, you will pay €240 in commission per year.
The On Account only required the following to have everything free:
The new Day by Day account to have everything free it is necessary to meet the following 2 conditions:

If you only meet the first condition, the bank will charge you €15 in commission quarterly (€60 per year).

Yes, it is possible, but you have to sign up for an ImaginBank account, CaixaBank's online office.
Customers can register quickly as explained on the ImaginBank website:
Once you are a client of the bank, transfer your receipts (or payroll) to Imaginbank and cancel everything you have in Caixabank and forget about commissions and links.
You will continue to be part of CaixaBank and with all the services:
The downside we found is that it only allows a single owner and a single account per owner.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"
794,BBVA gives away €100 for direct debiting a salary of €800 or a pension of €300,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bbva-regala-100e-por-domiciliar-una-nomina-de-800e-o-una-pension-de-300e/,06/09/2021,"If you have a payroll of €800 or a pension of €300, BBVA will give you €100 in cash if you open your Payroll account and direct debit your income there.
It is strange to talk about this bank and say no commissions, but if you domiciliate those income, both the account and the associated debit card have NO commissions, as well as the transfers...
The entity's website does not clarify the conditions of the promotion very well. But seeing how the last few times have been, it will surely require permanence (12 months?). In addition, surely request registration via mobile or web.
We believe that the ideal would be to first register as a bank customer via your free online account (Friend plan: €15) and then direct debit your payroll or pension.
In any case, before doing anything, make a call to the bank so that they can send you all the conditions.
The services provided by this account are:
On the previous occasion, once BBVA verifies that you meet the conditions, it will deposit the money into your account within 6 months from the first payroll direct debit.
The €100 bonus is subject to withholding, that is, the bank will deposit €81 net into your account and €19 will go to the Treasury.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
795,1% APR of Orange Bank and MyInvestor are the most profitable in September 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/el-1-tae-de-orange-bank-y-myinvestor-son-los-mas-rentables-de-septiembre-de-2021/,03/09/2021,"Deposits have already had continuous cuts for a decade. Currently, no deposit reaches 1% APR unless it is subsidized with payroll or deposits in foreign banks.
However, there are 2 exceptions, they are the Orange Bank and MyInvestor accounts, which remunerate your money at 1% APR.
Both accounts ask nothing in return (almost) from the client, remunerate at 1% APR and on top of that offer additional services at no cost.
Of course, both offers have their lights and shadows.
Yes, both banks give 1% APR. But with some limitations.
Orange Bank offers it for an indefinite period but for a maximum of €20,000.
MyInvestor is more limited, it offers this profitability only during the first year that you are a client and for a maximum of €15,000. Then at 0.1% APR.
The good thing about MyInvestor is that it guarantees 1 year of that profitability, and Orange Bank could give you more than 1 year or only for 2 months that 1%.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences in addition to what we have already said about the limitations of profitability:
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
Of course, you must take advantage of MyInvestor's initial promotion wisely.
If you have less than €20,000, make it profitable with Orange Bank. If you have more, and I would even say close to €35,000, I would also open MyInvestor to put €15,000 in this entity and have it give you that 1% APR for 12 months. Then look for another one that offers a reasonable interest.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, it can be contracted, but with some disadvantages (debit card with cost?).

797,Scissor in Wizink: affects all its savings products,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/tijeretazo-en-wizink-afecta-a-todos-sus-productos-de-ahorro/,01/09/2021,"A drop in profitability was expected in Wizink's savings products, but not the mega snip that the entity has hit its deposits.
The entity announced a reduction in the profitability of its savings account for today, September 1, to former clients and we hoped that it would also apply to new accounts and it has.
We also expected a cut in the profitability of their deposits, but not what they have done, to less than half:
The rest of the characteristics of your deposits have not changed:
Starting today, September 1, the savings account pays 0.05% APR for all the entity's clients: new and old:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
798,CaixaBank: Bankia customers will have to pay €36 per year for the debit card,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/caixabank-los-clientes-de-bankia-tendran-que-pagar-36e-al-ano-por-la-tarjeta-de-debito/,31/08/2021,"CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022.
In this sense, the bank is informing former Bankia clients that as of November 12, their card contracts will be transferred to the bank resulting from the merger.
This card, which has been free and was linked through Bankia's Por Ser Tú program, will have an annual fee of 36 euros starting next year.
Of course, clients who meet the requirements of the plan in the month of October: direct deposit of payroll and take out insurance, investment fund or use the credit card twice a month, will continue with the debit card for free, and until June 2022.
From October 1, 2020, CaixaBank required compliance with the following 2 conditions:

If you only meet the first condition, the bank will charge you €15 in commission quarterly (€60 per year).
If you do not meet any of the conditions, the commission amounts to €60 per quarter (€240 per year).
Oh, and be careful, you can only operate through their digital channels or at ATMs, since if you do it in their offices, they will charge you 2 euros per operation (Those over 65 years of age can carry out 4 free operations per month).
Of course, you get rid of commissions if you have one of the following accounts:
Oh, it also offers a free account to holders under 26 and new customers for the first year.
NOTE: The products to take into account for the €20,000 are: investment funds, fund portfolios, structured funds, managed portfolios, savings insurance and individual pension plans.
Yes, it is possible, but you have to sign up for an ImaginBank account, CaixaBank's online office.
Customers can register quickly as explained on the ImaginBank website:
Once you are a client of the bank, transfer your receipts (or payroll) to Imaginbank and cancel everything you have in Caixabank and forget about commissions and links.
You will continue to be part of CaixaBank and with all the services:
The downside we found is that it only allows a single owner and a single account per owner.


CaixaBank will carry out the technological integration with Bankia between Friday, November 12, and Sunday, November 14, 2021.
There will also be more commissions for Bankia customers: for the card and for the On Account
As we said a few days ago, Caixa Bank will eliminate the Bankia On Account and all its conditions and they will be transferred to the Day to Day Account with payment of up to €240 commission if you do not join (see here).
But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year.
Last Friday, Bankia merged with CaixaBank, with the CaixaBank name prevailing due to its prestige unlike Bankia.
But this predominance goes beyond its simple name, also in terms of marketing and product policy.

These accounts were lowered from 0.5% APR to 0.2% APR in the month of May 2021.
For new clients who sign up for the account now, the profitability is 0.1% APR, half of what old clients enjoy, but will it be double that of old clients or will they also lower it?
The entity communicated the change 2 months ago in which it did not even bother to explain the reason for the cut, it only reminded that its account is still commission-free.
In relation to the savings account(s) that you have contracted with WiZink, we want to inform you that, as of September 1, 2021, the interest rate on your WiZink savings account(s) will change to 0.05% APR1.

In addition, you will continue to have your money always available, so you continue saving in the simplest way.
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.
The interest rate on your deposits was set in August 2020 with a substantial drop:

The characteristics of its deposits are:

800,You don't like the change to the Portuguese FGD from BFS. You have 2 months to leave at no cost,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/no-te-gusta-el-cambio-al-fgd-portugues-de-bfs-tienes-2-meses-para-irte-sin-coste/,27/08/2021,"BFS (Banco Finantial Spain) plans to merge with its Portuguese parent BFT (Banco Finantial S.A.) and if you have deposits, your money will be under the protection of the Portuguese FGD.
This change will be applied from October 1, 2021 according to the bank's forecast and if the operation is authorized by the competent authorities.
Given that it is a unilateral change of conditions by the bank, clients have the right to terminate the contract, charging all interest until that moment and without applying the early cancellation conditions and any costs.
In this sense, the bank has informed clients, who have 3 months to make a decision from receipt of the communication (around July 22):

The Portuguese bank offers up to 0.85% APR on its fixed terms:
The characteristics of these products are:


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
801,What is Polygon?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/que-es-polygon/,27/08/2021,"The polygon token is an altcoin and protocol designed to connect blockchain networks within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its open source technology allows developers to work on an autonomous network based on the stability of the Ethereum network.
Created in October 2017 in India by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun. At first it was called MATIC, but in February 2021 it assumed the name Polygon. The creative team used the first version of Plasma which later became one of its most surprising advances.
Since the beginning of this year, various cryptoasset projects were announced to strengthen the support of Polygon smartcontracts, allowing greater scalability, exceeding the limits established by the Ethereum network.
With the launch of the AAVE lending protocol, it considerably increased its activity on the network, catapulting its price to historic levels.
In principle, its consensus system is based on the proof-to-stake mechanism unlike Ethereum which is based on proof-to-work, which is more expensive. In addition, it has a Heimdall architecture, created by Cosmos.
This type of blockchain, which Ethereum 2.0 is already developing to achieve this efficiency, and the Heimdall system, allow double consensus security and excellent transaction performance, greatly stabilizing the network, producing around 7,000 transactions in a second increasing scalability.
Its multichain system solves the typical problems of Ethereum, that is, it takes advantage of the advantages provided by the security and universe of Ethereum, but overcomes its shortcomings. This has made it a very attractive system for smart contract developers.
Why buy Polygon
First of all, you must take into account that as with any cryptocurrency, there are some risks that can still be seen despite the constant improvement of its security systems, so you should invest with caution.
Due to the existing congestion in level 1 users (Ethereum's first layer), Polygon's upper layer, which elevates it to level 2, allows you to enter the cryptoasset market without having to pay transaction fees to the users. miners.
If you are able to study and follow projects in development, especially smart contracts, you can obtain significant benefits.
To test your skill as an investor and financier in decentralized networks, you can enter Etoro, which allows you to make test investments as a practice system before going out to the real market.
Normally, exchanges are in charge of this type of transactions, however the P2P (Peer to Peer) system is gaining more and more space in transactional forms. The idea of ​​eliminating intermediaries and lowering costs is a constant in the crypto ecosystem.
There are various P2P platforms where you can find cryptoassets like Polygon such as LocalCryptos, LocalBitcoins and Paxful. Experts suggest that this purchasing system has the following advantages:
You can also buy them through CFD contracts, although the most advanced users do not recommend it for long-term investments, but rather for low-amount speculations.
Likewise, you can buy them with Paypal, credit, debit and ATM cards. For this, it is essential to use a recognized platform with high prestige.
Another of the big doubts of investors is knowing when to buy Polygon.
Polygon Matic is a complete system with many growth and development capabilities, so it is important to keep an eye on its progress and improvements. Its level of capitalization makes it an excellent investment alternative.
Like any other cryptocurrency, new developments and trends will affect Bitcoin in the next five years. Here are some Bitcoin predictions and what to expect in 5 years.

802,The best payroll capture offers from banks for August,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-mejores-ofertas-de-captacion-de-nomina-de-los-bancos-de-agosto/,26/08/2021,"The Bank of Spain (BdE) warned about the payroll raising offers that we published yesterday (see here).
But these offers are really bad or dangerous, or as a regular user (Kotxa) points out, the BdE is lending a hand to the usual banks so that the bleeding of clients who go to other banks does not continue.
We are going to analyze the current offers, as we have always done: permanence, requirements, etc.
Remind you that now, the exchange process is quite simple, fast and free, and without having to go to any office or speak to anyone from BBVA, with bank portability (see here).
Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you the €350 directly, but that they reward you all that money for leaving only €5,000 in the account for 2 years is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
Additionally, you can get another €50 if you sign up for the account via their Friend Plan (See here).
The offer is valid until December 31, 2021
Up to €300 for clients residing in certain communities (see here), €150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
It will be valid until September 30.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until December 31, 2021.
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In exchange, it requires direct debit if you direct your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit of at least 900 euros.
It also offers €40 until September 30 in exchange for a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit that must be equal to or greater than €1,000, or equal to or greater than €600 if you are between 18 and 31 years old.
Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become customers, the bank will continue to continually offer you new promotions.
ING usually gives away €50 (NOT in force) if you open a payroll account and direct deposit a salary or pension into the account if you are invited by a friend and client of the bank, who will also take €50 (see more details here)
The advantages of the account are:
Furthermore, having the payroll account exempts you from paying commissions in the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

BdE warns that with these campaigns what banks aim to achieve is to get a loyal customer: payroll, receipts and possibly other products such as cards, etc., and long-lasting.
The way to achieve this is via the payroll, ""from it, the bank will offer you other products and will try to be attentive to any need that arises so that the relationship with the entity is consolidated: a personal loan, a credit card , a deposit, a mortgage...""
For banks, ""customer loyalty is a value, banks make an extra effort and, sometimes, they are willing to pay for it.""
As we know, there are many offers, and as the BdE says, you must review all the conditions in detail, especially:
You must decide whether or not to change, not only looking at the ""gift"", but all the conditions:
If one gift is better than another, it does not mean that the account is better, you have to study it and see if it is adapted to your needs.
The BdE offers a list of questions you should ask yourself before accepting one of these offers:
It is nothing new for us, but it is good that the Bank of Spain makes this warning.


BBVA has been fined again for an amount of 4 and another 2 million euros for 2 serious violations in the sale of its mortgage products.
The entity was already sanctioned twice in 2018 for issues related to the granting of mortgages.
The Bank of Spain has issued a press release warning that the deadline to exchange pesetas for euros ends on June 30.
It also allows from tomorrow, Wednesday, June 23, to go to the offices of the Bank of Spain (any branch in Spain) without the need for an appointment.
Last June, the Bank of Spain (BdE) sanctioned Bankinter with the payment of a fine of 5,200,000 euros for a serious violation in the sale of mortgage loans.
In this way, Bankinter is added to the long list of fined banks, being the second bank with the highest fine after ING!!!."
804,NN Bank friend plan until December: €25 + account at 0.2% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/plan-amigo-de-nn-bank-hasta-diciembre-25e-cuenta-al-02-tae/,24/08/2021,"NN Bank has extended its Amigo Plan until December 31, 2021 in which it gives €25 to both the godfather and the godchild for the simple fact of opening (and little else) a savings account at 0.2% APR and without commissions .
This offer was valid until February 28, but was extended until June 30 and finally until the end of the year.
To get this bonus the bank requires:
As for the friend, it doesn't have to be a real friend of yours (if so, better), on the internet there are many people who offer to be your friend and you both win €25.
If you want, we could help you find a sponsor. We have codes, but if you want you can also organize among yourselves (leave comments below to be a godfather and/or godson).
The client's conditions are:
The conditions of the new client are:
Additionally, Guests who have canceled a Savings Account in the 12 months prior to the start of the promotion will not be able to participate in the promotion.
The Client will receive the €25 bonus at the end of the month in which the guest opens and activates the Online Savings Account.
The new client will receive their €25 at the end of the third month after having activated and deposited the minimum amount of €1,000.
More information here.
The catch is that it is a foreign bank, because for all intents and purposes NN Bank is a Dutch entity:
That is its weak point because it generates extra tasks for savers. However, you will not have extra tasks (except including interest in your income tax return) if you do not have more than €50,000 abroad.


NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account."
805,"Orange Bank and MyInvestor offer a 1% APR account, which is better?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-y-myinvestor-ofrece-una-cuenta-al-1-tae-cual-es-mejor/,23/08/2021,"MyInvestor and Orange Bank offer an account with a profitability that surpasses the rest of the offers.
1% APR is difficult to get right now, not even on long-term deposits. So there are 2 offers to take into account when investing your money.
Both entities offer the same profitability, at 1% APR. The problem is that MyInvestor does it only for the first 12 months that you become clients, while Orange Bank is for an indefinite period.
Thus, if you are a new MyInvestor client, and you are only looking to make your money profitable, perhaps this entity is better, because it guarantees you for 12 months at 1% APR, while Orange Bank can change the conditions at any day with a 2-month notice. .
If you are already a Myinvestor customer and you have already passed the 12 bonus months, the profitability it offers you is ""garbage"" (0.1% APR), Orange Bank is undoubtedly much more profitable.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences:
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
Of course, you must take advantage of MyInvestor's initial promotion wisely.
If you have less than €20,000, make it profitable with Orange Bank. If you have more, and I would even say close to €35,000, I would also open MyInvestor to put €15,000 in this entity and have it give you that 1% APR for 12 months. Then look for another one that offers a reasonable interest.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
806,What are the new fees for the Santander One Account like? and before?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/como-son-las-nuevas-comisiones-de-santander-one-y-antes/,20/08/2021,"Banco Santander, after surely a loss of clients, had to back down and change the conditions and commissions of its Santander One Account again.
These conditions did not last even 6 months, it began on February 15, 2021 and at the beginning of July it reversed and left Account 123 as it was.
The new commissions are very similar to those of the old Account 123. The bank charges €20 per month, but they will be exempt if one of the following conditions is met:
You would get a discount of €10 per month if the client meets one of the following conditions:
During these almost 6 months the bank established 3 groups of relationships:
1. Income and payment links:
2. Product Links
3. Shareholders (1,000 bank shares)
Depending on the links, the following commissions were charged.
The bank establishes 3 possibilities:
Fulfilling one of the 2:
In short, the basic services that people usually have: payroll, receipts and cards were not enough.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"

808,NN Bank now only remunerates your Savings Account at 0.2% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/nn-bank-ya-solo-remunera-su-cuenta-de-ahorro-al-02-tae/,18/08/2021,"NN Bank already remunerates all its clients at only 0.2% APR since last Monday, August 16, 2021.
This entity, a former collaborator of ING, offered up to 0.5% APR in 2018 and has been gradually lowering: Up to 0.4% APR, then up to 0.35% APR, then to 0.3% APR and now only 0.2% APR.
The bank alleges the cut due to ""the current market situation"" and that they are ""forced to modify the interest rate.""
Hello XXX XXXXX:
We are contacting you to inform you that due to the current market situation we are forced to modify the interest rate of the Online Savings Account that you have contracted with us. Therefore, as of August 16, 2021, the interest rate on your Online Savings Account will go from 0.30% APR to 0.20% APR.
We remind you that as stated in the terms and conditions of the account, the variable interest rate may be modified. If you do not agree with these new conditions, you can terminate the contract without any penalty for you, in line with the provisions of clause 19 of the Online Savings Account Product Conditions
The current account characteristics are:
NN bank has the drawback: it is a foreign bank and without a branch in Spain it generates additional tasks (if you have more than €50,000 abroad):
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*RenaultBank: its former clients continue at 0.65% until September 10, when it will lower it to 0.5% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.2% APR, but in September it will be 0.05%
As we have said, ING and NN Bank went hand in hand, in fact, previously the only ING offices were the insurer's points of sale.
In 2018, their paths seem to have parted ways with the launch of the savings account, which far surpasses ING.
The profitability offered by NN Bank during this time has been much higher than ING.
The pity is that NN Bank has NOT been established in Spain like ING, opening a branch and obtaining a Spanish BIC would save the issue of taking the money abroad.


NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account."
809,Renault Bank with technical problems in its electronic banking since Sunday,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/renault-bank-con-problemas-tecnicos-en-su-web-desde-el-domingo/,17/08/2021,"Several users and clients of Renault Bank are informing us that the entity is having technical problems that prevent them from operating through its electronic banking.
This is a ""widespread incident that they are trying to fix"" as the bank has acknowledged and has been doing so since at least last Sunday.
Today we continue to receive complaints from customers about its poor functioning and therefore they cannot use their money.
Customers have complained quite a bit about the registration process and customer service when they have these problems.
In February we already reported a similar problem (see here).
In addition, they are not very strict on the date of interest payment. As far as we know, it has already been delayed twice. The last time, in the month of June (see here).
This entity is not new to us. Until now we have known it as RCI Banque, a French entity whose deposits could be contracted in Spain.
With this launch, the bank was supposed to facilitate the contracting of its products: a website in Spanish and specific products for our country, but things are becoming more complicated.
Another point in favor is that opening a branch in Spain saves us from having to deal with the Treasury. This bank will apply personal income tax withholdings, it will operate like ING in Spain, only the FGD is French.
The bank offers 2 products whose profitability has been decreasing since it existed.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
810,BBVA is sanctioned again for bad practices in Mortgages,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/bbva-vuelve-a-ser-sancionado-por-malas-practicas-en-las-hipotecas/,12/08/2021,"BBVA has been fined again for an amount of 4 and another 2 million euros for 2 serious violations in the sale of its mortgage products.
The entity was already sanctioned twice in 2018 for issues related to the granting of mortgages.
Specifically, this time he has been fined for the commission of 2 serious infractions classified in article 15 of Royal Decree-Law 6/2012, of March 9, on urgent measures to protect mortgage debtors without resources:
4 Million fine for having ""failed to comply with the obligations derived from article 5.9 of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law, in relation to the information provided to clients about the existence and content of the code of good practices, as well as, in certain cases, on the information regarding the causes of denial of the requests or the documentation to be provided by the client.
2 Million fine for having ""failed to comply with some of the obligations derived from article 5.4 of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law, related to issues such as the moment in which the economic effects of restructuring must be applied, and, in certain cases, their term of amortization or the requirement of additional conditions to those established in the standard.
In November 2018, he was fined 1.5 million euros for » non-compliance with certain requirements relating to pre-contractual information to be provided to the client, to the way the APR is calculated, to the information provided in relation to compensation for interest rate risk in early repayments and the collection of commissions for registration cancellation and, finally, the custody of contractual documentation, obligations all established in Order 2899/2011 and Bank of Spain Circular 5/2012. .
In the same month, it was also fined 1.2 million euros for non-compliance with the limits imposed by Law 41/2007 on compensation for withdrawal of early repayments and the rules on the replacement of reference indices established in the Provision Additional Fifteenth of Law 14/2013″.
There are several banks sanctioned for non-compliance with regard to the delivery of pre-contractual information, the calculation of the APR that appears in said information and the omission of said rate in the contractual documentation, as well as the expenses passed on to clients for management services. .
Another similar and related infraction that banks have committed and that have been sanctioned appears to be non-compliance with Laws 41/2007, 2/1994 and 44/2002.
It's related to:
The banks fined are:
A curious fact is that Bankia and Sabadell do not appear; although they have already committed enough misdeeds with the issue of floor clauses.
Last July, the Bank of Spain (BdE) published a post regarding banks' payroll campaigns and their dangers on its banking client portal.
The Bank of Spain has issued a press release warning that the deadline to exchange pesetas for euros ends on June 30.
It also allows from tomorrow, Wednesday, June 23, to go to the offices of the Bank of Spain (any branch in Spain) without the need for an appointment.
Last June, the Bank of Spain (BdE) sanctioned Bankinter with the payment of a fine of 5,200,000 euros for a serious violation in the sale of mortgage loans.
In this way, Bankinter is added to the long list of fined banks, being the second bank with the highest fine after ING!!!."

The bank informed its clients that as of October 1, once they obtain authorization from the authorities, BFS (Banco Finantial Spain) will merge by absorption with the Portuguese BFT (Banco Finantial S.A.), the parent company of BFS.
Of course, the entity will open a BFT branch in Spain where clients residing in Spain will remain.
For practical purposes, there will be no big changes for Spanish clients, except for the FGD that will protect their money. It will move to the Portuguese FGD.
There will be no implications for personal income tax, you will NOT have to do form 720.
The money will continue to be in Spain (Spanish Branch) and will apply personal income tax withholdings that will be communicated to the Tax Agency. In the same way as ING.
If you are a client and do not want to continue with BFS, you can leave at no cost and collect all the interest generated.
This is because it is a unilateral change of conditions by the bank, clients have the right to terminate the contract.
In this sense, the bank has informed clients that they have 3 months to make a decision from receipt of the communication:

The Portuguese bank offers up to 0.85% APR on its fixed terms:
The characteristics of these products are:


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)

The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.

815,The best and most profitable savings accounts for the month of August 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-mejores-cuentas-ahorro-y-mas-rentables-del-mes-de-agosto-de-2021/,05/08/2021,"Savings accounts, like deposits, are suffering continuous cuts and all banks justify this due to the current situation of low rates.
We have had low rates for years, and they are what creates the current situation of lower rates, but that is what it is.
So far this year, there have been quite a few snips.
The worst, in April, the decline of MyInvestor. I happen to give only 0.1% APR on your account. 1% will only be for new clients and during the first year.
Wizink, since May 1, gives only 0.2% APR to former customers who opened the account before August 2020, and from September, only 0.05% APR.
EBN maintained the interest rate of 0.3% APR for former clients, but since May 1 it has been cut to 0.15% APR.
Pibank cut its Remunerated Account to 0.3% APR on June 15, leaving only the Payroll Account at 0.5% APR.
RenaulBank lowered its Va Contigo Account from 0.65% APR to 0.5% APR in the month of July. Their former clients continue to charge at 0.65% APR until September 10.
NN Bank will lower your account to 0.2% APR starting August 16.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*RenaultBank: its former clients continue at 0.65% until September 10, when it will lower it to 0.5% APR
*NN Bank: will lower your account to 0.2% APR on August 16.
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.2% APR, but in September it will be 0.05%
Seeing all the offer, the most profitable thing you can get now in a savings account is Orange Bank.
The bad thing is that it can only be contracted by customers with an Orange mobile line (at the end of 2021 it will no longer be necessary), although it is not a big problem either, you can become a prepaid customer (we have done it and it has not involved any cost).
Furthermore, once you register, you do not have to continue being an Orange customer. You can throw away the Orange card.
The account offers a Spanish IBAN but under the French FGD and has a limited maximum amount to be paid:
The shame is that it only pays €20,000.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
816,What is the future of Tron (TRX)?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/cual-es-el-futuro-de-tron-trx/,05/08/2021,"The world of cryptocurrencies is very complex to understand, some cryptocurrencies may have a much more promising future than others. But, despite all the predictions that can be made, the truth is that, in this world, any detail can generate great variations.
However, there is one currency that has a very promising future. We are talking precisely about Tron (TRX). According to some experts, the future of this currency seems to be one of the best in the sector. Next, I will tell you a little more about Tron and what we can expect from it in the future.
Tron is a blockchain platform that has been operating since 2017 and is operated by the Tron Foundation. The main objective of this currency is to serve as a global digital content and entertainment system.
This platform was developed in such a way that it was scalable, private and, above all, secure. This allows not only the foundation token, the TRX, to run on it, but any other that users want to create. That is, it works in a way quite similar to how Ethereum does today.
The token used by the platform is known as Tronix (TRX) and users have the ability to pay for a large amount of digital content with it. This includes music, movies, games, and pretty much anything else.
Today, the price of this token is 0.05 dollars per unit, the highest price recorded for this token has been 20 cents. Although like any other crypto asset it has had ups and downs, the price of TRX over time has been relatively stable.
It has a market capitalization of $4.23 billion as of the creation of this article. It has been growing slowly but steadily over the years. The truth is that this is a currency with a lot of potential, so it can be an interesting investment to buy tron ​​right now.
According to what has been learned, this token is expected to have great growth in the coming years. This is why buying at this time and at that price can generate a large amount of profit in the next 5 or 10 years.
There is a lot of talk about this token on the networks and outside of it. Some experts have assured that the TRX token could reach $10 in the next five years. However, the truth is that this scenario is unlikely, after all, in order to reach that figure, the growth it must have would be gigantic.
The truth is that Tron has had an increase in the number of investors and likewise, it varies depending on market trends. However, we must be realistic, which is why other experts have given a slightly more reserved assessment, but, even so, the estimated growth is quite considerable.
Tron is a quite promising coin, but seeing the market movements, it is very difficult for it to reach $10, however, it is not impossible either. Many experts agree that the price of this crypto asset will rise in the next 5 years, however, these predictions place it between $1.10 and $1.60 per unit.
That may not seem like a really promising price, however, that represents an increase between 2,500 and 3,000 percent. This is obviously a pretty large percentage for any token or cryptocurrency today.
In any case, we just have to wait to see how the market moves, since, in the event that there is great growth, perhaps those 10 dollars will not seem so crazy. After all, we have already seen the case of bitcoin that went from being worth a few cents to reaching more than $60,000.
www.tucapital.es offers this article for information purposes, it is not recommending anyone to invest in Cryptocurrencies and if they do it is at their own risk, which is very great.
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.

Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."
817,"In August, Pibank offers 1 deposit at 0.4%, 1 account at 0.3% and c. payroll at 0.5% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/en-agosto-pibank-ofrece-1-deposito-al-04-1-cuenta-al-03-y-c-nomina-al-05-tae/,04/08/2021,"Pibank maintains the offer of deposits and accounts unchanged, offering up to 0.5% APR on its Payroll Account.
Last May (the 14th), the entity cut the profitability of its deposit by up to half, from 0.8% APR to 0.4% APR.
In the month of June (the 15th) it lowered its remunerated account from 0.5% APR to 0.3% APR.
The only product that has not changed and is now the most profitable is its Payroll account which offers 0.5% APR.
The current characteristics of your deposit are:
The conditions of your paid account are:
The bank gives you 3 months to direct deposit any payroll or pension. If after this period you have not processed the direct debit, you will lose some of its advantages:
Internal transfers or transfers made by the account holder themselves are not considered payroll or pension.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.
You still have today and tomorrow to contract it at the current interest rate, which is 0.24 percentage points more than what it will offer."

As this client tells us, the bank told him that it is for security.
The problem is that this client was unaware of this limitation and is abroad with all of his money in the Savings Account, without being able to move it to the Checking account and be able to withdraw it with the card, which does work.
In short, he has money, but no. All you have to do is ask a friend/family member to deposit something into his checking account.
In order to go into more detail, we have contacted the bank and they tell us that, ""The App works in Western Europe, the United States and Canada.""
More specifically, in the following countries:
We asked him why it doesn't work in other countries, to which he replied that it is due to permit issues.
So if you are going to one of the countries that are not on the list, put money in the checking account if you plan to use your card to withdraw cash or pay in stores.
Good morning:
I have been following you for many years and I thank you for the work you do. This is the first time I am writing to you because I think it is a detail that may be important for some of your followers, like me. I have an account at OrangeBank, in which I have all the money in the savings account and when I have to use the card I transfer money to the checking account so that the savings account rewards me as much as possible. The fact is that I am going to be abroad for a month, within the European Union (Lithuania) and when I arrive in the country I find that the app does not work here. I write to OrangeBank and they confirm that I will have the app blocked for the entire month (""in accordance with the Operating Manual and for security reasons""). They tell me that I can use the card but not the rest of the operation. In my case, having 0 euros in the checking account and everything in the savings account means having the card also blocked, in addition to not being able to make transfers, bizum or the rest of the App's operations.
I'm telling you this in case you consider it appropriate to make an entry about it on your website.
And again, thank you for your contributions.
All the best


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

Thus, during this month it continues to offer the profitability of its deposits at a maximum of 0.8% APR and its Savings account continues at 0.1% APR
The profitability of deposits was established at the beginning of the month of June and the account since August 2020 and will possibly change in a short time.
Customers prior to that date enjoy 0.2% APR from May 1 (previously 0.5% APR), but from September 1 it will drop to 0.05% APR.

Wizink Deposits
The interest rate on your deposits was set in August 2020 with a substantial drop:

The characteristics of its deposits are:


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

Openbank launched a payroll campaign in the month of June in which it offers both new and existing clients €40 for direct debiting your income to the entity.
As income, Openbank receives payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the following amounts:

The process is simple:

The Welcome Savings Account offers 5% APR for 6 months and a maximum of €5,000.
The welcome bonus is €125 gross or just over €100 net, in exchange it requires:
In addition, the Payroll Account offers a 1% bonus on direct debit bills for electricity, gas, telephone, mobile and Internet.

822,Last days for the ING Amigo Plan: €50 for each person per payroll,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ultimos-dias-para-el-plan-amigo-de-ing-50e-para-cada-uno-por-nomina/,28/07/2021,"ING offers only until next Saturday, July 31, its Amigo Plan with which it aims to attract more and more payroll and a cost of €100 for each one.
There are therefore only a few days left to get a €50 bonus for both the ING client (godfather) with a payroll account, and his friend (godson) who deposits a payroll or pension on the recommendation of the former.
With the payroll account, it also exempts you from paying commissions on the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 500 euros.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
The promotion will last until July 31, 2021 unless extended again.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
As we understand, the card comes with full payment at the end of the month by default, but it is worth checking to avoid scares and not having to pay astronomical interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.

Cancel free of charge,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/tienes-deposito-en-bfs-y-no-quieres-cambiarte-a-bft-cancela-sin-coste/,23/07/2021,"BFS (Banco Finantial Spain) plans to merge with its Portuguese parent BFT (Banco Finantial S.A.) and if you have deposits, your money will be under the protection of the Portuguese FGD.
This change will be applied from October 1, 2021 according to the bank's forecast and if the operation is authorized by the competent authorities.
Given that it is a unilateral change of conditions by the bank, clients have the right to terminate the contract, charging all interest until that moment and without applying the early cancellation conditions and any costs.
In this sense, the bank has informed clients that they have 3 months to make a decision from receipt of the communication:

The Portuguese bank offers up to 0.85% APR on its fixed terms:
The characteristics of these products are:


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."
826,BFS deposits will be covered by the Portuguese FGD,https://www.tucapital.es/bancos/fgd-fondo-de-garantia-de-depositos/los-depositos-de-bfs-seran-cubiertos-por-el-fgd-portugues/,22/07/2021,"BFS (Banco Finantial Spain) will merge by absorption with the Portuguese BFT (Banco Finantial S.A.), the parent company of BFS, and will be a single Portuguese entity with implications for the FGD of customer deposits in Spain.
In this sense, the bank is communicating to its clients and it will become effective on October 1, once they obtain authorization from the authorities, and a BFT branch will be opened in Spain where clients residing in Spain will remain.
For practical purposes, there will be no big changes for Spanish clients, except for the FGD that will protect their money. It will move to the Portuguese FGD.
There will be no implications for personal income tax, you will NOT have to do form 720.
The money will continue to be in Spain (Spanish Branch) and will apply personal income tax withholdings that will be communicated to the Tax Agency. In the same way as ING.
The FGD is the entity that acts under private law and whose objective is to guarantee the money deposited in credit institutions, both in accounts and deposits. In addition to, in certain cases, strengthening the solvency and operation of credit institutions.
The European Parliament approved a reform of the deposit guarantee directive, which in the event of bankruptcy, savers will be able to request the return of their deposit of up to 100,000 euros per person from this fund within a maximum period of 10 business days, which will become of 7 from December 31, 2023.
But be careful, not all deposits are guaranteed, there are cases where they are not (see here), but it does not affect the normal deposits that are contracted by an individual at BFS.
The Portuguese bank offers up to 0.85% APR on its fixed terms:

The bank's requirements are:
This differential offer has bothered more than one user of our website, for example:
For more information, call 91 090 07 97.
The ATMs available are Euro 6000, Bankia, Sabadell, Bankinter, Caja de Arquitectos and Caja Ingenieros, except in Galicia, where you can do it as many times as you want at any ABANCA ATM.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
828,Orange Bank continues to allow you to contract the Account with a Prepaid number,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-sigue-permitiendo-contratar-la-cuenta-con-un-numero-de-prepago/,20/07/2021,"In the last week we have received some comments that we have received on our blog indicating that Orange Bank NO longer allows you to subscribe to your account with an Orange prepayment number.
We have contacted the entity and it confirms that the bank DOES allow you to contract with both a Prepaid card and a contract card.
The bank has responded in this same sense on its Facebook wall.
In fact, the bank's direction is towards a registration process without the need for an Orange number.
At the beginning of 2021, the General Director of the entity has assured that before the end of 2021, it can be contracted by all clients.
We already published the registration process once (see here), which is quite simple. We tried it.
Afterwards, you do not need to continue being an Orange customer if you follow the following steps:
Once you finish the 3 steps, you can do what you want with the Orange card:
Logically, the most interesting option is the second. There is no cost, you don't have to do anything, and if a promotion comes up...
But in short, you can be Orange Bank customers, without being an Orange customer; although during the process you had to be (1 week at most).
At the end of the year, all this nonsense will no longer be necessary. Of course, its connection with Orange will never disappear, and will always be the burden of this bank, because Orange is not very liked by a significant part of its former clients.
It is the only account that is remunerated at 1% APR (the most profitable) and for an indefinite period currently on the market:


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

That is, you have to use electronic banking, mobile banking or ATMs to pay bills and taxes, cash refunds, transfers and transfers, deposit checks, request a checkbook and query position, balance or statement.
You also have to give up postal mail. We are a 100% online customer.
The €150 promotion is aimed only at new payroll or pension direct debits and the process is very simple:
The bank requires a stay of 24 uninterrupted months; You have to have your payroll in Liberbank for 2 years in a row.

The advantages of the SIN Online account are:
The offer will be valid until June 30, 2021.


Several financial entities that offer money, up to €350, in exchange for your salary, and end their promotional campaign at the end of March.
But some, like Bankinter, have already renewed their offer and extended it until the end of June.
Liberbank has been offering a commission-free online account for a long time, as has BBVA, and the recent Santander and Sabadell accounts.
This account that asks nothing in return and gives you everything for free
In November we have up to 6 entities that offer money if you direct your payroll to their bank. Your salary has value, at least they spend it to get it from you, offering you up to €350 in cash.
Of course, they will ask you, like mobile or internet companies, for a permanence and some other demands."
830,Accounts at 1% APR. Orange Bank vs MyInvestor. What is the best account?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuentas-al-1-tae-orange-bank-vs-myinvestor-cual-es-la-mejor-cuenta/,16/07/2021,"MyInvestor and Orange Bank offer an account with a profitability that surpasses the rest of the offers.
1% APR is difficult to achieve at the moment, not even on long-term deposits. So there are 2 offers to take into account when investing your money.
If you are a new MyInvestor client, and you are only looking to make your money profitable, perhaps MyInvestor is better, because it guarantees you for 12 months at 1% APR, while Orange Bank can change the conditions at any day with a 2-month notice.
But I would take advantage of Orange Bank first, until it changes its conditions (if it does) or for the excess money that Orange Bank does not compensate me (see below).
If you are already a customer, the 1% will last until April 1 or until you reach 12 months as a bank customer. From that date, you should think about going to another bank and Orange Bank is a good alternative.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences:
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
Of course, you must take advantage of MyInvestor's initial promotion wisely.
If you have less than €20,000, make it profitable with Orange Bank. If you have more, and I would even say close to €35,000, I would also open MyInvestor to put €15,000 in this entity and have it give you that 1% APR for 12 months. Then look for another one that offers a reasonable interest.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
831,"NN Bank will again cut the profitability of its Savings Account, up to 0.2% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/nn-bank-recortara-nuevamente-la-rentabilidad-de-su-cuenta-de-ahorro/,14/07/2021,"NN Bank will lower the profitability of your Savings Account again. This time up to 0.2% APR and will come into effect from next August 16, 2021.
The change will apply to all customers, both existing customers and new customers from this moment on.
NN Bank, a former ING collaborator, offered up to 0.5% APR in 2018 and has gradually lowered it: To 0.4% APR, then to 0.35% APR, then to 0.3% APR current and in August, up to 0.2% APR.
The bank alleges the cut due to ""the current market situation"" and that they are ""forced to modify the interest rate.""
Hello XXX XXXXX:
We are contacting you to inform you that due to the current market situation we are forced to modify the interest rate of the Online Savings Account that you have contracted with us. Therefore, as of August 16, 2021, the interest rate on your Online Savings Account will go from 0.30% APR to 0.20% APR.
We remind you that as stated in the terms and conditions of the account, the variable interest rate may be modified. If you do not agree with these new conditions, you can terminate the contract without any penalty for you, in line with the provisions of clause 19 of the Online Savings Account Product Conditions
The current account characteristics are:
NN bank has the drawback: it is a foreign bank and without a branch in Spain it generates additional tasks (if you have more than €50,000 abroad):
As we have said, ING and NN Bank went hand in hand, in fact, previously the only ING offices were the insurer's points of sale.
In 2018, their paths seem to have parted ways with the launch of the savings account, which far surpasses ING.
The profitability offered by NN Bank during this time has been much higher than ING.
The pity is that NN Bank has NOT been established in Spain like ING, opening a branch and obtaining a Spanish BIC would save the issue of taking the money abroad.


NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account."

Payment of bonuses will be made once compliance with the previous points is verified.
BBVA allows you to sponsor a maximum of 10 new clients, so you can earn a total of €150.
NOTE: if you want to be a godfather or godson, leave a comment below.
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, it can be contracted, but with some disadvantages (debit card with cost?).


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .

Specifically, the entity has reduced the remuneration of the Va Contigo Account from 0.65% APR to 0.5% APR, which will be applied now to new clients, and to existing clients as of September 10, 2021.
This is how the bank has communicated to its clients via email. The botched thing about the case is that it is sent from an email from ""cajarural.com"" (infomail@cajarural.com)!!!
This is because Renault Bank uses the Caja Rural platform, but could have sent an email from its own domain.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.
Dear Customer:
At Renault Bank we inform you promptly and transparently about any modification of the conditions agreed in your contracts.
Therefore, we inform you that, as of 09/10/2021, the conditions of your Contigo Account are modified, in accordance with the provisions of the fifth condition of the contract, as follows:
-The nominal interest rate applicable to your account with you will be 0.50% per year.
It will be the only change that your account will experience as you will be able to continue operating at no cost and without any type of commission.
You will be deemed to accept the indicated contractual modifications if you do not notify the Bank of your lack of conformity or non-acceptance, prior to the proposed date of entry into force.
If you wish, you will have the right to terminate the contract without any additional cost and with effect from any time prior to the date of entry into force of the modification.
Thank you for your trust in us.
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. We will be happy to help you!
All the best,
Renault Bank
The entity has not even been operating in Spain for 1 year and the fourth cut is underway.

Your Account Va Contigo continued with its launch profitability, but now it suffers the first cut to 0.5% APR.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.

Main advantages of the Wizink ME Card:
Additional services:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 19.99% APR.
The card comes with deferred payment by default, change it to full payment at the end of the month so you don't have to pay interest.

The 4-step process as indicated by the bank is simple:
Orange Bank allowed its clients to use Bizum at the beginning of 2021 by integrating it into its APP. It was what the mobile bank was missing (APP only).
In this way, the entity has many advantages: free immediate transfers, all ATMs free to withdraw cash (3 times a month) and rewards up to €20,000 at 1% APR.
The account offers a Spanish IBAN but under the French FGD and has a limited maximum amount to be paid:
It is also giving a €30 bonus to new customers who link their card with a payment application and use it (see here).
Orange Bank allows you to send money immediately through free immediate transfers for a maximum of €15,000 per operation.
The only difference with respect to Bizum is that it requires knowing the recipient's account number.
The entity allows you to withdraw cash from any ATM in the EU without commissions. Of course, it is limited to 3 operations per month, which we believe is enough.
It is necessary to be an Orange customer to register with OrangeBank, which is of little concern because there is a free way (see here).

The Dutch entity offers €50 to an ING client (sponsor) with a payroll account, who brings a friend (godson) to the entity and who direct deposits a payroll or pension, with the friend also taking €50.
With the payroll account, it also exempts you from paying commissions on the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 500 euros.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
The promotion will last until July 31, 2021 unless extended again.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

Wizink Deposits
The interest rate on your deposits was set in August 2020 with a substantial drop:

The characteristics of its deposits are:


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
841,Wizink will lower the profitability of your account to 0.05% APR in September,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/wizink-bajara-la-rentabilidad-de-su-cuenta-al-005-tae-en-septiembre/,30/06/2021,"Wizink is informing its clients 2 months in advance that the profitability of their account will drop to 0.05% APR starting September 1, 2021.
The entity's website shows the unchanged profitability (at 0.1% APR), but we imagine that tomorrow, July 1, it will lower it to 0.05% APR?
Old customers (before August 1, 2020), until now enjoying the 0.2% APR, double that of new customers, will see their remuneration reduced by a quarter in 2 months.
These accounts were lowered from 0.5% APR to 0.2% APR in the month of May 2021.
In the statement, the bank no longer even bothers to explain the reason for the cut, only the cut and that your account remains commission-free.
In relation to the savings account(s) that you have contracted with WiZink, we want to inform you that, as of September 1, 2021, the interest rate on your WiZink savings account(s) will change to 0.05% APR1.
Remember that your WiZink savings account/s have no commissions and are remunerated from the first euro and with no limit on the maximum balance.
In addition, you will continue to have your money always available, so you continue saving in the simplest way.
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.
The interest rate on your deposits was set in August 2020 with a substantial drop:

The characteristics of its deposits are:


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

The marketing period for this product ends next July 7, that is, there is one week left for its contract.
This product, combined as we say, offers a deposit at a good return (1% APR), but requires you to invest the same amount of money as the deposit in an investment fund of the entity.
What is the same if you want to make an investment, your money will be distributed as follows:
The information on profitability and term is somewhat confusing. The bank has sent an email indicating that it is 1% APR for a 12-month term, but its website indicates that it is 1.2% APR for a 24-month term and also for 12 months.
The minimum investment will be €20,000, €10,000 in the deposit and €10,000 in the investment fund.
The characteristics of the deposit that is under the Spanish FGD are:
The funds that EBN sells are 3:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
843,MyInvestor now gives you €10 per month for 1 year if you become a client and…,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/myinvestor-te-da-ahora-10e-al-mes-durante-1-ano-si-te-haces-clientes-y/,29/06/2021,"As of April 1, 2021, the joy at MyInvestor ended and the bank stopped offering the 1% APR on its savings account to all customers.
Since then, only new customers enjoy that profitability and for 1 year.
Taking into account that the bank remunerates a maximum of €15,000 at that interest rate, it means €10 net per month for 1 year. In total, €120.
In this sense, the bank announces itself: ""We will pay you up to €10 per month just for the first year!""
Okay, few banks offer this, but existing customers are not happy, they now charge only 0.1% APR.
The current account characteristics are:
Minors can also open this account and deposit €15,000 and get €10 per month in net interest.
To open the account you need:

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
844,"Santander, Openbank, Caixa… have already paid the points aid",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/santander-openbank-caixa-ya-han-pagado-la-ayuda-de-los-puntos-prestacion-por-hijo-a-cargo/,28/06/2021,"The POINTS aid, or family aid for children or benefit for dependent children, is officially collected on the 16th of July and January.
Last year, due to COVID, Social Security advanced the payment to June 26 from July 16, but in December they did not pay it until January 16, the official date.
The next official payment, as we say, will be on July 16, 2021 to all people who were entitled in 2020 and who in 2021 have made the annual income declaration and have not been beneficiaries of the Ingreso Mínimo Vita (IMV) aid. .
However, there are entities that have already advanced the payment of the aid as of June 25, 2021. We have been able to see the details of the payment from both Banco Santander and Openbank (see image).
Additionally, there are beneficiaries who are indicating that they have also collected money from different banks. We cannot confirm that information (see here):
The only thing you can do if you are clients of those banks is to check it.
You will be paid at the latest on July 16.
Since the entry into force of the Minimum Vital Income (IMV), you can NO longer request aid from points, the aid was integrated into the IMV.
The downside is that NOT all those who could benefit from the help of POINTS are entitled to the IMV due to the issue of HERITAGE. In this way, future parents stay without this help and will not charge the IMV either.
The current beneficiaries will continue to receive payment indefinitely as long as they continue to meet the requirements (Seventh transitional provision of Royal Decree-Law 20/2020).

If you are beneficiaries of the points aid, Social Security (SS) has ex officio analyzed or is analyzing your situation to see if they grant you the IMV. If you have the right, they will notify you and if not, then nothing. You remain the same and without news from the SS.
However, many have requested it anyway, fearing that the SS do not have enough data, and have been denied help.
The fact that you are denied the IMV does not mean that you lose family support for children. If for any reason you do not collect it on Monday, January 18, 2021, make an appointment at Social Security. They have to fix your situation.
If you are granted the IMV, you automatically stop collecting points.
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more."

The €300 offer is only for the Communities of Madrid, Asturias, the Basque Country, Navarra and Rioja, the rest have to settle for half, €150.
In exchange, the bank asks:

For more information, call 91 090 07 97.
The ATMs available are Euro 6000, Bankia, Sabadell, Bankinter, Caja de Arquitectos and Caja Ingenieros, except in Galicia, where you can do it as many times as you want at any ABANCA ATM.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

This date was effectively the end date of the previous Plan Amigo Campaign, but the bank has relaunched it with an end date of June 30 or December 31, 2021.
The new date indicated on the bank's website as you can see in the following screenshot is December 31, 2021.

On the other hand, the legal bases (see here) contain something else, until June 30, 2021.

Thank you.
These advertising campaigns are carried out by the Bankinter Partner department.
We believe that internally there has not been good communication between this department and customer service. In fact, the work done is a bit shoddy. Different dates on the website and in the legal bases.
If you have registered asking for the promotion, they have to give it to you. Present the legal bases document. You fulfill it.

It also allows from tomorrow, Wednesday, June 23, to go to the offices of the Bank of Spain (any branch in Spain) without the need for an appointment.
Of course, people who have a prior appointment will have preferential attention.
The deadline to exchange peseta banknotes and coins for euros at the Bank of Spain ends on June 30. In order to facilitate the exchange for citizens who still have pesetas, as of Wednesday, June 23, it will no longer be essential to request an appointment to carry out this procedure, although people who have obtained said appointment will have priority.
To speed up the exchange and avoid waiting for the public, the Bank will offer a quick system for delivering pesetas for counting and subsequent payment to the current account indicated by the presenter.
The change can be made both at the central headquarters of the Bank of Spain in Madrid (C/Alcalá, 48) and at any of its branches, distributed throughout the national territory. Public service hours are Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
People who want to make the exchange must come equipped with an ID, passport or residence card and respect the security measures recommended by the health authorities.
It is worth remembering that all peseta banknotes put into circulation after 1939 can be exchanged. For banknotes issued between 1936 and 1939, it is necessary to carry out a prior analysis by the experts of the Bank of Spain. All coins that were in circulation at the time of the launch of the euro can also be exchanged, including 2,000 peseta coins and collector, commemorative and special coins. All bills and coins are exchanged for their face value, that is, €1 for every 166,386 pesetas.
Last July, the Bank of Spain (BdE) published a post regarding banks' payroll campaigns and their dangers on its banking client portal.
BBVA has been fined again for an amount of 4 and another 2 million euros for 2 serious violations in the sale of its mortgage products.
The entity was already sanctioned twice in 2018 for issues related to the granting of mortgages.
Last June, the Bank of Spain (BdE) sanctioned Bankinter with the payment of a fine of 5,200,000 euros for a serious violation in the sale of mortgage loans.
In this way, Bankinter is added to the long list of fined banks, being the second bank with the highest fine after ING!!!."

The campaign will last until October 20, 2021 and offers its customers who buy an Amazon Check through Evo Banco receive a 3% bonus.
If you buy a check worth €100 (it costs you €100), Evo Banco will give you a check worth €103.
Or looked at another way, if you want, for example, the final amount of the check to be €100, you must buy one for €97.08 (€100/103). You pay €97.08 and get a check for €100.
The bad thing is that Evo Banco does not allow you to do that, since it has to be in sections of €10 and for a minimum value of €20; So if you don't want to have money in Amazon, adjust the check to the closest price and pay the rest with another means of payment.
The process is very simple:
Additionally, the bank allows payment of said check in 2 ways:
You can buy checks for a minimum value of €20 and up to a maximum of €2,000, and in installments of €10.
As we say, the offer will be valid until October 20, 2021.

It is the big difference that exists between this bank and others such as Banco Santander, BBVA, Banco Sabadell or CaixaBank that having your payroll directly debited is not enough to have a commission-free account, and they force you to connect more.
These entities charge up to €240 in commission even with direct debit payroll (see here).
Bankinter has the friend plan in force until December 31, 2021 applicable to the contracting of a Payroll Account (from €800 in payroll) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 in payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below.
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until December 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).
>> See promotion bases
Until July 31, 2021, Bankinter offers its offer to remunerate you at 5% APR during the first year, and a second year at 2% APR for the money you deposit in the Payroll Account.
But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000 (young Bk, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
It is a good offer considering that it is the same (even improved in terms of requirements) as what was offered at least 9 years ago (We published it for the first time in 2012). And since then the landscape of accounts and deposits has changed radically.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
The total bonus for both promotions would be €400 gross (€260 in the case of Bk Young) or €324 net (after paying taxes) for the new customer. The bank spends €450 for each payroll.
Be careful, only the Payroll Account is worth it. If you do not have a payroll, you will only be able to get €350 in interest.
It is a good offer and a good alternative to attract those dissatisfied with the latest changes at BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Bankia or even Banco Sabadell.
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:
This offer will be available until July 31, 2021. Offer valid until 40,000 new accounts have been contracted.

850,The 3 key points to understand how CFDs work in trading,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/los-3-puntos-claves-para-entender-como-funcionan-los-cfd-en-trading/,17/06/2021,"Despite being an activity that has been practiced for many years, in the world of trading there is still a lot of confusion on the part of the most novice users about how certain financial products work. To a large extent, the operation and etymology of a CFD or contract for difference is often confused, believing that it is related to another type of financial product.
CFDs (contract for difference) or contracts for difference are contracts where the broker and the client agree on a payment based on the success of the rise or fall in the prices of certain assets. To do this, tools such as FBS metatrader 5 are used, where users can know in real time the behavior of the price of stocks, goods, currencies, crypto assets and more.
These work as financial derivatives, and their operation is quite simple, their value is determined based on the price of another asset. And these are the 3 most important characteristics to know about its operation:
One of the great confusions that is usually found is that users think that by opening a position they are acquiring an asset. The reality is not that, CFDs are simply contracts where a payment is stipulated based on a price projection.
That is, these do not give the client ownership of any asset, but rather a contract to be collected in the event that what was stipulated at the time of opening the position is fulfilled.
It is possible that the broker charges commissions on the product or on the account, each transaction may have intermediation costs. Likewise, maintaining the account may have a periodic cost that will be subtracted from the balance from time to time. Regular fees for payment methods used online must also be considered.
On the other hand, the risks of investment loss may be up to the total amount invested. That is, this type of contract is opened with an amount of money invested, from which profits will be obtained in proportion to the differential in the change in the price of an asset, the same case will happen the other way around, in case of losing said proportion will be subtracted from the initial investment, the maximum possible losses will be the total of the initial amount depending on the case.
It is possible to get even more benefit from CFDs through modifications to the contract bases. To do this, riskier tools such as leverage are used. In this way, a contract can offer profits greater than the proportion of the change in the price of the underlying asset, be it a stock, currency, cryptocurrency, etc.
Likewise, leverages involve greater losses than those usually incurred with a common CFD, so it is recommended to use them with caution when you are a novice trader.
Despite this, leverages involve modifications that make CFDs quite attractive products, which are usually used by trading experts to obtain significant profits from their operations on trading platforms.

The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."

It affects your Tú+ Deposit for a 24-month term from 0.85% APR to 0.75% APR.
The initial profitability of this product was 1% APR when the bank opened an office in Spain on November 12, 2020.
Its 2 star products, the Contigo Account at 0.65% APR and the Tú+ Deposit, whose profitability has been cut twice by the bank.
In any case, both the account and its deposit are among the most profitable on the market, the penalty is the registration process.
People are having a lot of problems and customer service is practically non-existent: avalanche of customers? lack of foresight? both?
This entity is not new to us. Until now we have known it as RCI Banque, a French entity whose deposits could be contracted in Spain.
With this launch, the bank facilitates the contracting of its products directly through a website in Spanish and offering specific products for our country.
In addition, it now has a branch in Spain and therefore will apply personal income tax withholdings. Let's say it will work like ING in Spain, only the FGD is French.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?

852,Renault Bank pays interest again with some delay,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/renault-bank-vuelve-a-pagar-con-algo-de-retraso-los-intereses/,16/06/2021,"Renault Bank is once again late paying the interest on its account and/or deposits from the settlement for the month of June. Something similar already happened in December.
In this sense, some users have contacted us asking about the problem.
I wanted to share with you the fact that yesterday, 06/15, the interest settlement on the Renaultbank account with an income of 0.65% should have occurred and this has not happened. Yesterday throughout the day I called twice when I saw that said settlement was not reflected and they told me in both calls that the accounting calculation processes were being extended but throughout the day and as a deadline of 11:59 p.m. it would be reflected.
Not only has this not been the case, but at this time and on the 16th, said interest settlement still does not appear reflected.
Of course I have sent an email to Renault bank asking for explanations for all this.
This time it is your Contigo Account, which must pay interest on December 15 and June 15. 2 times per year.
We tried to find out by contacting the bank, but they declined to comment. She was even rude by not paying any attention to us, because we were not customers.
It was through the chat on their website and a lady whose initials were: M.R. helped us.
On the other hand, she did give a response to one of our users (thank you) and a bank customer.

[M.R.]
Yes, interest settlement deposits will be made throughout the day, sorry for the inconvenience
They also responded to their clients via email:
Dear customer, xxxxWe apologize for the inconvenience caused.
We inform you that the interest settlement of the Contigo Account is generated on June 15 and, therefore, you will be able to see the credit in your account throughout today.
If you have any questions or clarifications, do not hesitate to contact us.
Thank you so much,
The Renault Bank Team.
In December, the bank entered the interest on the 16th, but putting the value date on the 15th. We imagine that this time they will do the same; but at 8:00, the last report received indicates that he is still not paid.


As you have read, Orange Bank, a branch in Spain, offers deposits of more than 3% APR through the Raisin platform, Dutch version, and for clients in the Netherlands.
We were shocked when one of our users sent it to us via email.
Openbank continues to invent nonsense, like the previous milonga of €60 per balance increase, which we criticized at the beginning of the month of December.
This time, the entity offers a deposit with a fairly normal profitability (0.75% APR), but as if to make it excellent or attract attention, it gives you €20 in an Amazon check, if the deposit is €10,000 or more.
This is what needed to happen at Renault Bank to end the patience of many of its first clients.
There are many complaints about the opening process, about customer service, and now their electronic banking is down and it has been going on for several days!!!"
853,ING gives you security tips and avoid cybercriminals,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ing-te-da-consejos-de-seguridad-y-evitar-a-los-ciberdelicuentes/,15/06/2021,"ING is sending emails to its clients so that ""this holiday, hackers don't have a blast.""
The Dutch entity gives 5 safety tips ""that will help you spend a calm and very safe summer"":
Yes, we know that an open Wi-Fi network can be very tempting (especially when we are limited in megabytes). But be careful: not all of them have adequate protection and could cause the theft of your data, especially if you carry out some sensitive operation from them such as a payment or accessing your bank's app.
Wouldn't you have ever distrusted a (seemingly) innocent USB plug? Well, it's time to start doing it. For a few years now, it has been common to find charging points through USB ports in almost any public place. However, experts advise against using them since they can be subject to a computer attack through the port itself, from where malicious software is installed to access passwords and data.
Solution? Use your own charger in a normal outlet (pun intended).
On vacation it is normal for us to disconnect and forget a little about everything... including many apps or services that we usually use. This represents an added risk in the event of a possible attack, since it may take days or weeks until we realize it.
Therefore, it is important that you check if your passwords are strong enough (no qwerty or 123456) to resist these attacks. In your ING app, it will also help you to have Mobile Validation activated as a more secure double validation method.
…which when push comes to shove are more of a trap. When closing your vacation, be wary of those offers that seem too attractive, both on flights and accommodation, especially if they arrive by SMS, WhatsApp or social networks.
In summer we spend more time outside the home and in places that pose a greater risk to our devices, such as the pool or the beach. You won't be surprised to know that it is precisely at this time of year when we most regret incidents that affect our devices... and the data we store on them.
We recommend that you anticipate and, before going on vacation, make a backup copy of your most important data. This way you will leave with the peace of mind of knowing that, if something happens, you will be able to recover everything.
ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
854,Which banks are left without commissions and without conditions?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/que-bancos-quedan-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condiciones/,14/06/2021,"Banks are increasingly demanding more from their clients to exempt them from commissions. It seems like they are competing to see who will charge the most (up to €240, see here)
The worst of all is that banks like BBVA, which has worsened its conditions twice in 6 months, are attracting clients (see here).
However, there are alternatives, we have 13 entities in mind and we have made a comparison between them.
If you want to see the details of each bank, you can read the articles that talk about these banks (see here and here).
NOTE: we have eliminated Pibank from the list, because if this bank does not direct deposit a payroll, it does not give you a card nor does it allow direct deposit of receipts. It would be a Remunerated account at 0.3% APR (very interesting), but it would only be a savings account and there would be many more, such as Renaultbank (0.65% APR).
If you read us from your mobile phone, put it in landscape mode to see the following table, it will look much better. Thank you.
Entities that allow cash withdrawals at all ATMs have limitations: number of times or require a minimum amount.
There are entities that only allow withdrawals at their own ATMs and others have agreements with a wide network of ATMs. Check our ATM traffic light (here).
We consider that it has offices, if it has enough. Not like ING or Evo Banco whose number is very small. Openbank only has one office of its own, but you have all the Santander offices to withdraw money for free.
Other entities that have offices, but require payment of commissions if you want to operate in them (cost).
We consider that it does have offices, although it requires certain conditions, such as Abanca, which allows you to withdraw cash for amounts that cannot be done at an ATM.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients and for an initial 12 months and is limited to €15,000.
*Orangebank limits its profitability to €20,000.


In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Activo Bank has gone for years without any major news, and now it is because it seems that it is reaching the end of its life.
The entity reports on its website that its Active Account ""cannot be contracted temporarily."" Searching more online, the entity plans to migrate these clients to Banco Sabadell, in a new online account, in the style of BBVA or Banco Santander.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because they want to or because they are too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:"
855,"Summer promotion: Double welcome gift, up to €200 at Raisin",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/promocion-verano-regalo-bienvenida-doble-hasta-200e-en-raisin/,11/06/2021,"During the summer, Raisin offers the “Double welcome gift” promotion in which it gives you up to €200 welcome for making a deposit on this platform.
The promotion period will last until July 5, 2021 and is compatible with other promotions.
It is aimed at new clients who, depending on the amount of the investment they make, can obtain a bonus of up to €200.
The minimum investment period for all products is 6 months and the bonus will be deposited:
This promotion will be available only to new customers until July 5, 2021, after which the bonus will be halved.
We do not recommend anyone make a deposit in a single bank above what is covered by the FGD, which is €100,000 per entity (Raisin does not allow it either).
This platform currently has 19 collaborating entities from more than 10 countries with returns of up to 1.36% APR.
Some of the banks that offer the best profitability on the platform are:
We remind you that deposits are contracted in these banks, and that Raisin is a mere intermediary. Thus, the money is deposited in the countries to which each bank belongs and its consequences:
Some of our users have asked us why Raisin is not included in the records of the Bank of Spain.
And so, it is, because according to Raisin, its business model does not require any authorization/license to operate in Spain.
Your money when transferred to Raisin, is deposited in Raisin Bank based in Germany and under the German FGD.
Once you contract a deposit, the money will be deposited in the collaborating bank and under the FGD of origin of said bank.


Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting.
Many taxpayers avoid the annual procedure of submitting the income tax return if they are within certain income limits and types of income, because the Treasury considers that adequate withholdings have been applied to these people.
However, if you have had any deposit from the Raisin platform, except Haigton Sucusal in Spain, you will have obtained interest that has NOT been declared to the Spanish Tax Agency, and therefore, you have the obligation to file your income tax return and add said interests obtained abroad.
""Due to the high number of applications received by CA Auto Bank, new applications will temporarily not be accepted,"" is how it appears on the Raisin website dedicated to the products of this entity recently launched via this platform.
In this way, the Auto Bank offer goes on standby in less than 2 weeks after its launch. The truth is that the interest rate offered by this bank was very attractive."

Key, the online account",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bbva-capta-024m-de-clientes-record-con-sus-comisiones-clave-la-cuenta-online/,10/06/2021,"BBVA attracted 241,243 clients in Spain from January to April 2021, 70% more than 1 year ago and setting a record in the month of March with almost 72,000 new clients.
How is this possible with all the changes made by the bank lately?:
We believe the key is your Online account, which is commission-free and is not affected by the changes made by the entity.
According to the bank, the growth rate of online customers is increasing, pointing out that 70% of its customers in Spain are already digital.
The bank attributes the arrival of new customers through digital channels to the wide range of digital services, the quality of its mobile banking app and the simplicity of the account opening process.
That may be, but we believe it is above all because it is totally free unlike their physical banking accounts that even charge you to say hello.
In fact, we think that some of their physical banking clients have switched to online banking.
The entity offers:
You will be charged commissions if:
The account allows up to 2 holders, and the best thing is its card, one of the most advanced to avoid fraud (card fraud, see here):
This is the Aqua card.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."

What is the same if you want to make an investment, your money will be distributed as follows:
The information on profitability and term is somewhat confusing. The bank has sent an email indicating that it is 1% APR for a 12-month term, but its website indicates that it is 1.2% APR for a 24-month term and also for 12 months.
The minimum investment will be €20,000, €10,000 in the deposit and €10,000 in the investment fund.
The characteristics of the deposit that is under the Spanish FGD are:
The funds that EBN sells are 3:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
858,ING Amigo Plan: offers €50 to the godfather and €50 to the godson in June for opening a payroll account,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/plan-amigo-ing-ofrece-en-junio-50e-al-padrino-y-50e-al-ahijado-por-abrir-cuenta-nomina/,08/06/2021,"ING has once again launched its Amigo Plan, with which it aims to attract more and more payroll and a cost of €100 for each one.
The Dutch entity offers €50 to an ING client (sponsor) with a payroll account, who brings a friend (godson) to the entity and who direct deposits a payroll or pension, with the friend also taking €50.
With the payroll account, it also exempts you from paying commissions on the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 500 euros.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
The promotion will last throughout the month of June.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120

In this sense, we have received messages from our users and clients and we have been able to verify that indeed at 2:00 p.m., it is still not working.
In the bank's brief statement, it indicates that ""the service will soon be available again,"" but the truth is that nothing is known about how long this drop in service will last.
The only consolation is that this bank is a savings bank, and unless you have a deposit due today, there is practically nothing to do or operate.
EBN Banco cut the profitability in half (from 0.3% APR to 0.15% APR) of its savings account in the month of February, affecting new customers.
The old ones continued until April 30 at 0.3% APR, and from May 1 also at 0.15% APR

The 2 products can be contracted for new money that you take to the bank and you can constitute it from the first euro and up to 1 million euros.
Evo Banco has removed its 2 deposits with a 4 and 12 month term at 3.1% APR and 2.85% APR respectively, and launches one with a 6 month term and 2.85% APR.
This is a fixed period for raising liquidity, allowing all clients to be hired to bring new money to the bank.
Evo Banco has launched 2 liquidity collection deposits with a decent profitability of 3.1% APR at 4 months and 2.85% APR at 12 months.

An extension that is out of the ordinary: they have always been monthly.
As for its paid account, it offers 0.1% APR to new clients since August 2020. Clients prior to that date enjoy 0.2% APR from May 1 (before 0.5% APR).
Wizink Deposits
The interest rate on your deposits was set in August 2020 with a substantial drop:

The characteristics of its deposits are:
The savings account also suffered a drop in the month of August 2020. But it affected only new accounts, from 0.5% APR to 0.1% APR.
The old accounts continued at 0.5% APR until April 30, but since May 1 they are remunerated at 0.2% APR, yes, double that of new clients:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

864,Bankinter: Earn up to €340 the first two years and without commissions,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bankinter-gana-hasta-340e-los-dos-primeros-anos-y-sin-comisiones/,28/05/2021,"Bankinter says: ""Earn up to €340 the first two years and without commissions."" And yes, it is true, you can earn €340 during the first 2 years if you open your payroll account and meet its conditions.
It seems incredible that this account has been going on for more than 9 years (at least, we published it for the first time in 2012) without changing the conditions of your account, with everything that has happened since then.
This entity offers until June 30, 2021 its offer to remunerate you at 5% APR during the first year, and a second year at 2% APR for the money you deposit in the Payroll Account.
But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000.
A client could get at most:
In total, €341.76.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
The total bonus for both promotions would be €400 gross (€260 in the case of Bk Young) or €324 net (after paying taxes) for the new customer. The bank spends €450 for each payroll.
Be careful, only the Payroll Account is worth it. If you do not have a payroll, you will only be able to get €350 in interest.
It is a good offer and a good alternative to attract those dissatisfied with the latest changes at BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Bankia or even Banco Sabadell.
Bankinter has the friend plan in effect until May 31, 2021 applicable to the contracting of a Payroll Account (from €800 of payroll) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 of payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below.
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until May 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).

The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:
This offer will be available until June 30, 2021. Offer valid until 40,000 new accounts are contracted.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."

Yesterday, Congress approved, with the vote in favor of all parties except the PP and VOX, the limitation on the use of more than €1,000 in cash also for private consumers.
Until now, and since a PP Government limited it, we could pay for purchases of up to €2,500 in cash, useful for purchasing, for example, appliances or furniture.
It is clear that governments, of any color, want to favor the banks. Because the extra cost of electronic payment methods charged by banks is reflected in the price of things.
Banks earn via POS terminals and via card commissions.
In 2012, a PP government limited the cash payment to €2,500 when one of the parties involved was a company or professional.
The current government (PSOE + Podemos) with the support of almost all parties, except PP and VOX, have approved in Congress to reduce this limit to 1,000 euros for all operations: including payments from individuals.
Only payments between individuals or between individuals and financial institutions will continue without limits.
It has already been approved in the Congress of Deputies, now it will have to be ratified in the Senate and will come into force in a few months.
The sanction will consist of a fine of 25% of the amount paid in cash. Both the payer and the person receiving the payment are jointly and severally liable for the infringement.
The party who reports the transaction within 3 months from the date of payment is exonerated from liability.
The simultaneous presentation of a complaint by both parties will not exonerate any of them from liability.
Now that the banks say that they do not want money from their clients, and they have been charging companies and large holders of cash for some time now, and recently, 2 banks have opened the ban (see here) to charge individuals (ING and BBVA ), the Government wants to further limit the use of cash.

866,Banco Pichincha lowers the profitability of its account to 0.1% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/banco-pichincha-bajara-la-rentabilidad-de-su-cuenta-al-01-tae/,26/05/2021,"Banco Pichincha lowers the profitability of its interest-bearing account to 0.1% APR, shortly after Pibank did so, but at 0.3% APR.
For many months, Pibank has offered more interest than Pichincha (0.5% APR compared to 0.3% APR), but things changed in April, when Pibank also lowered it to 0.3% APR.
But it did not last long, Pichincha has already reduced the paid account for new clients to 0.1% APR and has informed old clients that the reduction will apply from July 27.
It is a strategy that the entity follows, prioritizing its online office clients:
These are the conditions of your paid account:
It will be the same both in the physical office (Pichincha) and in its online office (Pibank) and with the same characteristics:
This account can only be contracted through Pibank, and continues to offer without change in conditions and at 0.5% APR.
The entity requires you to direct debit only a payroll or pension (without specifying the amount) and you will have the following advantages:
It also allows you to try it for 3 months without having to direct deposit your payroll or pension.
Once that period has passed and you continue without direct debit, you lose its advantages: profitability and it will be difficult for you to withdraw money from ATMs.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
867,"New electricity rate 2.0TD, more expensive, effective next TUESDAY and will not affect everyone",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/nueva-tarifa-de-luz-mas-cara-en-vigor-el-proximo-martes-y-no-afectara-a-todos/,26/05/2021,"The new 2.0TD electricity rate will come into effect next Tuesday, June 1, which will be more expensive and will have time discrimination.
However, this change will NOT affect all households, only those families that have contracted the regulated PVPC rate (small consumer voluntary price, formerly TUR).
As we have already indicated on several occasions, the PVPC is the cheapest rate in most cases (up to €200 cheaper per year, see here), with the change it will continue to be the same, but you will have to pay something more.
According to Ingebau estimates, using the prices published by the government we will all pay more or less what those who do not have time discrimination pay right now.
Those who do not have time discrimination will pay more or less the same, but they will have that, time discrimination.
Here we have the result: pic.twitter.com/d3L5QgwEaq
— ingebau (@ingebau) February 26, 2021

The new 2.0TD electricity rate is a rate with time discrimination of 3 sections during working days (Monday to Friday):

The 24 hours on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays are considered off-peak hours.
It looks quite similar to the current 3-section one. There will be 2 hours less peak than the current system during weekdays, and we will have cheap electricity all weekends.
The schedules also change, starting the peak hour earlier (10:00) but we will have electricity at an average price from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
With the new pricing, the ideal would be to concentrate all consumption between 00:00 and 8:00 on weekdays and weekends: put the accumulators, water heaters, dishwashers, washing machines at that time.
You can also choose 2 different powers:
Here one considers lowering the power during off-peak hours (from 0:00 to 8:00). But be careful, it affects the power of the entire day on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays.
You must verify what power you need at all times, and what you are willing to do.
If you are used to turning everything on at any time, leave your power as it is (unless you have a stupid one).
But if you don't mind, you could carry out a study and adapt the power to your needs to pay a little less.
Personally, after studying the rate, we are going to change little with respect to what we have already been doing.
We will continue with the power as it is, currently 3.45 KW at all times. It perfectly supports the oven and 2 or 3 induction hobs and the lights at the same time (nothing more).
We will try to run the washing machines on the weekends and the dishwasher at night.
We have already programmed the electric water heater to accumulate hot water (75º-80º, 100 liters) during off-peak hours, which will allow us to shower in the morning and/or when returning from work at night.
We will cook like now, when it's time, regardless of schedules.
It seemed strange to us that politicians were going to legislate for the benefit of consumers and taxpayers or the majority of them.
It would have been like this if they had maintained the prices and forced everyone to use the time-sensitive rate.
What it is really going to do is equalize everyone, making those who currently pay less pay more, the time discrimination thing.
In the month of April 2021, the new electricity rate (2.0 TD) will come into effect, which will have time discrimination for everyone and will benefit many people.
We tell you why, and what the new 2021 electricity rate will be like.
During the month of January, it appeared in all written and electronic media that the price of electricity was at historic highs, creating almost alarm among consumers.
But that didn't affect everyone and now the price is at its lowest either. Only to those from the PVPC.
Both then and now, almost all of those in the PVPC (half of the households) pay less than those in the free market. And we can prove it to you."

He suspects that the problem may arise from the fact that he signed up with an Orange prepaid number and then changed it to his usual number.
He took advantage of what we mentioned, that it is not necessary to be an Orange customer to be an Orange Bank customer, it is only necessary during registration (see here).
When you go to reinstall the APP, it asks you again to validate as a client, via code and SMS; but he did not receive it and suspects that it is being sent to the Orange phone number that he no longer has.
He found the solution via email with the bank, which we now attach below.
In case you're wondering, I registered with Orange Bank and then changed my phone number to my regular one.
I recently had to reinstall the App and there was no way, it first sent a code to me and then to another device (I don't know which one it is because I never had another physical phone).
I think maybe it's the primitive Orange SIM card, I don't even know where I have it.
Searching the Internet THERE IS NO PHONE to call.
I sent an email to this email, we will help you and with this response I managed to recover my account (pay attention to points 5 and 6)



We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.

Other banks have already changed and are charging the new fees.
We have found good alternatives to these banks that offer everything for nothing (see here and here).
In total, there were 11 main banks and another 3 that our users contributed at the time that we also included.
The advantages of each bank were described there, which we collect in this article in a comparative table; much more intuitive and easier to see the good in each one.
NOTE: we have eliminated Pibank from the list, because if this bank does not direct deposit a payroll, it does not give you a card nor does it allow direct deposit of receipts. It would be a Remunerated account at 0.5% APR (very interesting), but it would only be a savings account and there would be many more, such as Renault Bank (0.65% APR).
If you read us from your mobile phone, put it in landscape mode to see the following table, it will look much better. Thank you.
Entities that allow cash withdrawals at all ATMs have limitations: number of times or require a minimum amount.
There are entities that only allow withdrawals at their own ATMs and others have agreements with a wide network of ATMs. Check our ATM traffic light (here).
We consider that it has offices, if it has enough. Not like ING or Evo Banco whose number is very small. Openbank only has one office of its own, but you have all the Santander offices to withdraw money for free.
Other entities that have offices, but require payment of commissions if you want to operate in them (cost).
We consider that it does have offices, although it requires certain conditions, such as Abanca, which allows you to withdraw cash for amounts that cannot be done at an ATM.

In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Activo Bank has gone for years without any major news, and now it is because it seems that it is reaching the end of its life.
The entity reports on its website that its Active Account ""cannot be contracted temporarily."" Searching more online, the entity plans to migrate these clients to Banco Sabadell, in a new online account, in the style of BBVA or Banco Santander.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.

The declaration that must be made now, in 2021, corresponds to the income of 2010, so it only affects savers who have obtained interest during 2020 abroad.
This applies to all users with accounts on:
The normal thing is that the interest obtained from foreign banks does not appear in the tax data, because they are not obliged to communicate it to the Treasury.
In this way, we have to add it on our own in the income tax return.
These interests have the same treatment as the interests obtained in Spain, they must be included in the 2019 Income in Box 027.
What we have to do is add the interest obtained in Spain to the gross interest obtained abroad in the Complete Income box and nothing in withholdings and expenses.

If the income has been obtained from a country with an agreement to avoid international double taxation (Not in countries considered tax havens), taxpayers can avoid paying the same taxes twice.
Ideally, when opening an account abroad, you should indicate to the bank in question that you are not a resident of that country so that they DO NOT apply any withholding tax to you.
But if this is not the case, and withholdings are applied, these cannot be added in the withholdings box, but rather you must put them as deductions for International Double Taxation (Box 588):

The lower of the following 2 values ​​may be deducted:
RentaWeb will calculate this value automatically, generally, the deduction will be 19% (generally) if the tax rate abroad is higher than that of Spain, and otherwise, the taxes paid abroad.
Taxpayers who have requested NO withholding abroad because they are non-residents have the obligation to file the declaration because they have income exempt from withholding.
Taxpayers who have the right to the deduction for international double taxation and exercise such right since 2015 may also do so via draft Web Income Tax, something that was not allowed in previous years.
I also remind you that you have certain obligations for having an account abroad.
>> See more about obligations for having an account abroad
Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."

It is the big difference that exists between this bank and others such as Banco Santander, BBVA, Banco Sabadell or CaixaBank that having your payroll directly debited is not enough to have a commission-free account, and they force you to connect more.
These entities charge up to €240 in commission even with direct debit payroll (see here).
Bankinter has the friend plan in effect until May 31, 2021 applicable to the contracting of a Payroll Account (from €800 of payroll) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 of payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below.
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until May 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).

Until June 30, 2021, Bankinter offers its offer to remunerate you at 5% APR during the first year, and a second year at 2% APR for the money you deposit in the Payroll Account.
But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000 (young Bk, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
It is a good offer considering that it is the same (even improved in terms of requirements) as what was offered at least 9 years ago (We published it for the first time in 2012). And since then the landscape of accounts and deposits has changed radically.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
The total bonus for both promotions would be €400 gross (€260 in the case of Bk Young) or €324 net (after paying taxes) for the new customer. The bank spends €450 for each payroll.
Be careful, only the Payroll Account is worth it. If you do not have a payroll, you will only be able to get €350 in interest.
It is a good offer and a good alternative to attract those dissatisfied with the latest changes at BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Bankia or even Banco Sabadell.
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:
This offer will be available until June 30, 2021. Offer valid until 40,000 new accounts are contracted.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."
875,The best and most profitable savings accounts of the month of May 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-mejores-cuentas-ahorro-y-mas-rentables-del-mes-de-mayo-de-2021/,12/05/2021,"In May we had 2 cuts, that of Wizink and EBN Banco, after suffering a more important one in the month of April by MyInvestor.
On April 1, former MyInvestor clients began to charge 0.1% APR on their account, unless they have not yet been with the entity for 1 year. In this case, it will continue at 1% APR until one year of being a bank customer.
Wizink, since May 1, gives only 0.2% APR to former customers who opened the account before August 2020.
EBN, which also maintained the interest rate of 0.3% APR for former clients, has been cut to 0.15% APR since May 1
Additionally, on June 15, Pibank will cut its Remunerated Account to 0.3% APR, leaving only the Payroll Account at 0.5% APR.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.2% APR
*Pibank will lower its Remunerated Account to 0.3% APR starting June 15.
It is the most profitable thing that can be achieved now in a savings account, the bad thing is that it can only be contracted by customers with an Orange mobile line (at the end of 2021 it will no longer be necessary), although it is not a big problem either, you can become a customer of prepaid (we have done it and it has involved no cost).
Furthermore, once you register, you do not have to continue being an Orange customer. You can throw away the orange card.
The account offers a Spanish IBAN but under the French FGD and has a limited maximum amount to be paid:
It is also giving a €25 bonus to new customers who link their card with a payment application and use it (see here).
It is the most profitable and under the Spanish FGD, the bad thing is that it is limited to the first €15,000, but as we say it is only during the first year that you become a customer.
Once this period has passed, the remuneration is only 0.1% APR.
The account characteristics are:
More recent entity with an online branch in Spain (Spanish IBAN). It works in a similar way to ING. Of course, customer service and processes leave a little to be desired.
Offers a high-yield savings account and deposit under the French FGD:
Under the Spanish FGD. This is the online branch of Banco Pichincha. Until now it offered 0.2 percentage points more than its physical banking, but not anymore.
It also has deposits of up to 0.4% APR.
If you open the payroll account you would have all the services, and the Account at 0.5% APR.
It is the same as Pibank, but with offices and lower profitability.
With Spanish FGD, Wizink offers 0.2% APR on accounts opened before August 1, 2020.
NN Bank offers your account under the Dutch FGD at 0.3% APR:
This is the only account with a foreign IBAN. The money is in Holland and is not subject to withholding. The client must declare the interest in the income tax return.
Furthermore, since the money is abroad, if you have more than €50,000 outside of Spain you have to complete form 720 annually.
Since July, EBN offers its account at 0.15% APR under the Spanish FGD.
It usually has high-profit deposits, but its marketing is now suspended.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
876,Renault Bank offers Account at 0.65% APR and Deposit at 0.85% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/renault-bank-ofrece-cuenta-al-065-tae-y-deposito-al-085-tae/,10/05/2021,"Renault Bank currently offers an account and one of the most profitable deposits on the market despite the recent rate cut.
The entity without completing 6 months in Spain made its first cut last month and affected its Tú+ Deposit with a 24-month term from 1% APR to 0.85% APR.
This entity has been operating in Spain since November 12, 2020 with 2 star products, the Contigo Account at 0.65% APR and the Tú+ Deposit.
As we have said, despite the drop, both the account and its deposit are among the most profitable on the market, the penalty is the registration process.
People are having a lot of problems and customer service is practically non-existent: avalanche of customers? lack of foresight? both?
This entity is not new to us. Until now we have known it as RCI Banque, a French entity whose deposits could be contracted in Spain.
With this launch, the bank facilitates the contracting of its products directly through a website in Spanish and offering specific products for our country.
In addition, it now has a branch in Spain and therefore will apply personal income tax withholdings. Let's say it will work like ING in Spain, only the FGD is French.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."

Being right now an option to take into account for our savings.
The Portuguese bank offers up to 0.9% APR on its fixed terms and under the Spanish FGD. Of course, the bank has been progressively lowering remuneration in recent years.
Currently the bank offers from 0.5% APR and requiring a large investment amount:
The characteristics of these products are:
The tranquility deposit can be contracted until May 22, 2020, but the bank extends this period weekly.
These products have 2 disadvantages:
The entity is of Portuguese origin, but is in Spain as a financial entity and under the Spanish FGD.


BFS has launched a deposit at 3.6% APR and a 12-month term for large investments: from €100,000.
It is a fixed term, non-cancelable with an extra return of 0.35 percentage points on an investment of less than €50,000.
BFS has cut, for another week, the profitability of its deposits. This time, it has affected its shorter terms: 12 and 18 months, and they are in fact the most profitable products, up to 3.15% APR.
The rest of the terms remain the same, and are offered below 3% APR.
BFS cuts its deposits a little more, now the maximum that can be obtained in this entity is 3.25% APR for 12 months in a non-cancelable fixed term.
The decrease affects practically all of its deposits, except for the 36-month cancelable deposit, which will continue at 2.6% APR.
In addition, it has eliminated the non-cancelable 36-month fio term at 2.75% APR."

Starting next June 15, 2021, the bank will lower the profitability of its Remunerated Account from the current 0.5% APR to 0.3% APR.
These are the conditions of your paid account:
It will continue to pay 0.5% APR and will not change any of its conditions.

Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Pibank has improved its Payroll Account, if you have at least €5,000, and if you have more than €10,000 in the account, it even surpasses its remunerated account.
Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.

In this sense the bank is communicating to its clients. As a reason, the bank is going to make changes to its system and will affect both its APP and its web client area.
The scheduled time for suspension will be:
During this time you will not be able to operate with your Online Savings Account or view any type of information about it.
NN Bank recently extended its Amigo Plan until June 30, in which it gives €25 to both the godfather and the godchild for the simple fact of opening (and little else) a savings account at 0.3% APR and no commissions.
Demands:
As for the friend, it doesn't have to be a real friend of yours (if so, better), on the internet there are many people who offer to be your friend and you both win €25.
If you want, we could help you find a sponsor. We have codes, but if you want you can also organize among yourselves (leave comments below to be a godfather and/or godson).
The client's conditions are:
The conditions of the new client are:
Additionally, Guests who have canceled a Savings Account in the 12 months prior to the start of the promotion will not be able to participate in the promotion.
The Client will receive the €25 bonus at the end of the month in which the guest opens and activates the Online Savings Account.
The new client will receive their €25 at the end of the third month after having activated and deposited the minimum amount of €1,000.
More information here.
The catch is that it is a foreign bank, because for all intents and purposes NN Bank is a Dutch entity:
That is its weak point because it generates extra tasks for savers. However, you will not have extra tasks (except including interest in your income tax return) if you do not have more than €50,000 abroad.


NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account."
880,"Wizink deposits in May giving at 0.8% APR, all accounts at 0.2% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/depositos-wizink-en-mayo-dando-al-08-tae-todas-las-cuentas-al-02-tae/,04/05/2021,"Wizink maintains its deposits unchanged in May 2021, offering a maximum profitability of 0.8% APR.
But since May 1, customer accounts from before August 2020 are remunerated at 0.2% APR, until now it was 0.5% APR.
New clients from that date are remunerated at 0.1% APR.
Wizink Deposits
The interest rate on your deposits was set in August with a substantial drop:

The characteristics of its deposits are:
The savings account also suffered a drop in the month of August 2020. But it affected only new accounts, from 0.5% APR to 0.1% APR.
The old accounts continued at 0.5% APR until April 30, but since May 1 they are remunerated at 0.2% APR, yes, double that of new clients:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
881,"I can't leave BBVA and they are going to charge me commissions, what do I do? Can I get free?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/no-puedo-irme-del-bbva-y-me-va-a-cobrar-comisiones-que-hago-puedo-librarme/,03/05/2021,"Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are (see here), but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost, such as:
In any case, you have to evaluate the cost of the change: canceling the deposit, subrogating the mortgage, against the commissions that will be paid over the months.
There are 2 ways to act and depending on a date, April 29, 2012 and the issue is exclusivity.
You must leave the account for exclusive use of the link. If it is a mortgage, for example, an account only for the payment of installments with money deposited via transfer.
The bad thing is that if your mortgage requires or gives you a bonus, for example the direct debit of a payroll, you would fail to comply with the conditions or lose the bonuses.
1. Before April 29, 2012
The Bank of Spain says that: «The accounts are maintained by imposition of the entity and are used exclusively to pay the interest on a deposit, or to service a mortgage or personal loan, or payments derived from any other type of operation. , it is not up to clients to bear any maintenance and/or administration commission.""
2. After April 29, 2012
From that date onwards, you can be charged for an exclusive use account for the linked product.
But, the Bank of Spain indicates that the bank must have ""previously informed clients about the requirement - if applicable - to contract the linked account; of the total cost corresponding to the maintenance of said account; that both the contracting and its cost are expressly included in the contract, and that said cost cannot be unilaterally modified by the entity throughout the life of the loan, credit or deposit.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to charge you anything either.

As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.
We tell you a way to get rid of commissions in these cases.
A bank has you tied up and now it is raising the account fees. There is a way to get rid of commissions.
If you have an account for exclusive use of that bondage, you cannot be charged anything."

These numbers are due to 2 factors that in our opinion: how badly the other banks are doing and how well (or at least, less badly) that ING is doing.
The others only know how to raise and raise commissions, see BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Sabadell... It seems that they are competing to see who charges their clients more. Logically, customers are not stupid and are looking for alternatives.
ING, on the other hand, has an excellent track record, has happy customers and during the first quarter the bank has activated its friendly plan to capture payrolls on several occasions.
Also, another move that the bank has made that gives it a bad image, but it has surely gotten more clients with payroll. Charge commissions on the Orange Account. This is exempt if you have a payroll account or do not deposit more than €30,000 in the account.
Yes, since April 1, 2021, ING charges 10 euros in commissions per month on your Orange Account unless you meet one of the following conditions:
The €10 that the bank charges non-compliant customers is called the balance custody fee. That is a fallacy (see here)
And he sells his Orange account as an account for his Payroll Account clients to save, indicating that it is perfect for saving because:
Just compare with those that offer the most right now in bank accounts:
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.5% APR and starting in May at 0.2% APR
*EBN maintains 0.3% APR for former clients, and as of May 1, it will drop to 0.15% APR
*Pibank will lower your account from 0.5% APR to 0.3% APR starting June 15, 2021


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.

The Dutch entity offers €50 to an ING client (sponsor) with a payroll account, who brings a friend (godson) to the entity and who direct deposits a payroll or pension, with the friend also taking €50.
On this occasion the campaign deadline is not set, at least we have not found it.
NOTE: The campaign is not active.
With the payroll account, it also exempts you from paying commissions on the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 500 euros.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.

The entity has already removed the remuneration for new accounts contracted since February 24, 2020, but had maintained this profitability for the old accounts.
Well now, the bank has informed its clients that it will also stop remunerating them as of June 28.
We inform you that, starting next June 28, 2021, the interest rate on the current account (included in the Specific Conditions of the Facto Contract) will be 0.00% TIN (0.00% APR).
Keep in mind that this change does not affect the rest of the contractual conditions of the Facto Account Contract and, of course, nor the impositions that you have in force (which maintain their conditions until expiration).
Your Facto Account continues to have no administration and maintenance fees and transfers to the linked account remain free.
Facto Account does not accept any type of direct debit (among others, receipts or payrolls).
We already mentioned that Facto was one of the most profitable deposits on the market in 2020, reaching up to 1.25% APR.
But in 2021 it will be irrelevant. It lowered profitability in November 2020 and snipped in March 2021, giving a maximum of 0.01% APR.

Days
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.


Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
885,It is not Unicaja or Orange Bank... it is Bizum that limits to 60 operations per month,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/no-es-unicaja-u-orange-bank-es-bizum-que-limita-a-60-operaciones-al-mes/,27/04/2021,"A couple of weeks ago we told you that both Unicaja and Orange Bank had lowered the limit of operations per month that will allow their Bizum clients from 150 to 60.
BBVA has also had that limit for some time.
Today we have received a statement from Evo Banco, in which it clearly tells us that it is BIZUM that ""one of its conditions has changed"" and that ""as of June 15, the maximum limit of monthly operations received by identification document is reduced."" at 60«.
In fact, if you consult the Bizum website in its frequently asked questions, it still states that the limit is 150, without indicating that in the coming months it will drop to 60.
In any case, we think they are enough for private people: 60 a month is like 2 a day, every day.
Another issue is for professionals and companies that may be using this payment system.
Bizum is a service to send and receive money instantly and without needing to know the Current Account, just the recipient's phone number.
In this way, it is a faster, more agile and friendly service than a bank transfer.
It also allows you to make online payments, and also payments in physical stores (members).
Furthermore, at the moment no bank affiliated with Bizum is going to charge for this service, although you never know in the future. Each bank can set rates and commissions just like any other banking service.
Yes, you can transfer money between your accounts instantly using Bizum.
The buts, that you need 2 mobile lines and for movements of a small amount of money (within the limits of Bizum).
Keep in mind that Bizum associates an account with a mobile number. Once configured (from the bank's APP), you can send money from one of your accounts (Mobile No. 1) to another of your accounts (Mobile No. 2).
In addition, the change (associating number to account) is done instantly, you can configure it according to your needs at all times.
Currently the banks that offer this service are those in the following list in alphabetical order. If your bank is not there, you will not be able to do a Bizum (or send or receive money).
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .

This check can be used to purchase products included in your online catalog and sold by Amazon.es or any other seller that sells through the Amazon.es platform.
The advantages of the card are:
I never recommend deferring payments, because the interest rate in this case reaches up to 20.76% APR.
The card comes with deferred payment by default, change it to full payment at the end of the month so you don't have to pay interest.
The granting of the card depends on the entity's risk assessment.
NOTE: check if the promotion is in effect at the time of signing up. At the time of publication of this article, it is, but we cannot guarantee a later date.

887,Bankinter friend plan until May: €50+€50 and 5% APR in exchange for payroll…,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/plan-amigo-bankinter-hasta-mayo-50e50e-y-5-tae-a-cambio-de-nomina/,22/04/2021,"Bankinter offers until the month of May, its friend plan in which it offers €50 to both the godfather and the godson in addition to remunerating your money at 5% APR during the first year and 2% APR during the second year, in exchange for the direct debit of a payroll.
It is the big difference that exists between this bank and others such as Banco Santander, BBVA, Banco Sabadell or CaixaBank that having your payroll directly debited is not enough to have a commission-free account, and they force you to connect more.
These entities charge up to €240 in commission even with direct debit payroll (see here).
Bankinter has the friend plan in effect until May 31, 2021 applicable to the contracting of a Payroll Account (from €800 of payroll) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 of payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below.
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until May 31, 2021.
Be careful, from what they told us about the previous promotion, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years old, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules (check with the bank).
>> See promotion bases
Until June 30, 2021, Bankinter offers its offer to remunerate you at 5% APR during the first year, and a second year at 2% APR for the money you deposit in the Payroll Account.
But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000 (young Bk, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
It is a good offer considering that it is the same (even improved in terms of requirements) as what was offered at least 9 years ago (We published it for the first time in 2012). And since then the landscape of accounts and deposits has changed radically.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
The total bonus for both promotions would be €400 gross (€260 in the case of Bk Young) or €324 net (after paying taxes) for the new customer. The bank spends €450 for each payroll.
Be careful, only the Payroll Account is worth it. If you do not have a payroll, you will only be able to get €350 in interest.
It is a good offer and a good alternative to attract those dissatisfied with the latest changes at BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Bankia or even Banco Sabadell.
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:
This offer will be available until June 30, 2021. Offer valid until 40,000 new accounts are contracted.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."

If you are a customer and want to sponsor new accounts, you must enter your electronic banking, both web and mobile APP, in the ""invite a friend"" section.
In this section you can see your promotion code to be a godfather, which you must share with your friends and family so that they can use it during the process of registering the BBVA Online account, along with the Aqua card.
The godson will also have to use the Aqua card to pay for a purchase for an amount equal to or greater than 15 euros within a maximum period of 3 months from registration.
Payment of bonuses will be made once compliance with the previous points is verified.
BBVA allows you to sponsor a maximum of 10 new clients, so you can earn a total of €50.
NOTE: if you want to be a godfather or godson, leave a comment below.
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, it can be contracted, but with some disadvantages (debit card with cost?).

889,"Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank or Sabadell, which is the most linked and/or the most expensive?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/santander-bbva-caixabank-o-sabadell-cual-es-el-mas-vinculado-y-o-el-mas-caro/,20/04/2021,"We already published a similar article, but since then things have changed.
CaixaBank and Bankia have merged and BBVA will modify the conditions starting June 15 (see here).
How will the commissions be? Which bank is going to be the most ""abusive"" in terms of connection fees?
NOTE: There are other alternatives in several banks to be exempt from commission (click on each bank to see all the detailed conditions).
Unicaja is missing from this list, which is even more demanding (see here)
If you want a physical account in these entities and without links you have to pay, Santander and CaixaBank being the most expensive.
Of course, in all of them you have a loophole and that is to sign up for an online account:
All of these accounts are commission-free and unconditional (they only ask that you be an online customer).
As you can see, for Santander and BBVA, just linking you with payroll is useless, you will continue paying the same commissions. If you want to pay less, you have to bond more.
BBVA gives you a discount if you have income and “receipts or cards.” In this case instead of paying €160 commission, you will pay €60.
We can consider these 3 links as normal and easy to comply with for the majority of clients.
It would be having practically everything in that bank, it would be your main bank. But despite that, there are some of these 5 banks that will continue to charge you a commission.
For a basic client, it also requires a mortgage or insurance or an investment fund or a pension plan, although there are other alternatives.
1. Basic clients:
2. Shareholders (1,000 bank shares)
3. Select Clients or private banking.
In addition to the payroll, it requests one of the following links:
Without a doubt, Banco Santander takes the cake. From practically giving the best on the market with Account 123 and its high profitability, to being the worst of the worst accounts on the market. The most expensive or the most linked.
In today's world, you have to become online clients of banks, you will have many more advantages. You will continue to be clients of the same banks but without the links and without the commissions.
Furthermore, if you are a physical banker of some of these entities, you cannot go to their offices to carry out certain operations because they will charge you commissions: BBVA (€2) or CaixaBank (€2).
Our recommendation is to go to other entities, currently there are interesting alternatives:
As you can see, there is something to choose from.


Today we give voice to Mercedes who complains about Banco Sabadell for withdrawing its friend plan early, according to its announcement and without informing customers.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Banco de Sabadell ends the campaign in which it offered a 6% TIN during the first 3 months for a maximum of €20,000 to new customers.
Starting today, both new clients who sign up for this account, as well as existing account clients, would obtain a 2% APR for an indefinite period, and the limit remains €20,000."
890,Fed up with BBVA? List of alternative banks that give you up to €480 for your payroll,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/harto-de-bbva-lista-de-bancos-que-te-da-hasta-480e-por-tu-nomina/,19/04/2021,"BBVA is going to change the conditions of its payroll account twice in 6 months: on December 15, 2020 (see here) and next June 15, 2021 (see here), raising the requirements and/or commissions. They do not value at all what it costs to attract clients and mistreat them.
Unfortunately, not all of your clients will leave: some because they have ties that are difficult to release and others for reasons we do not understand; but the rest, please, change banks.
There are other entities that are eager to attract you by offering you entry bonuses and/or better conditions.
Some give you everything without asking for anything (we published it a few days ago, see here) and others offer you €480 as a bonus, in exchange for payroll and some connection.
Logically, the second option requires a permanence in exchange for that bonus. If you're not willing to accept that, choose the first one.
Now, the exchange process is quite simple, fast and free, and without having to go to any office or speak to anyone from BBVA, with bank portability (see here).
Deutsche Bank offers €20 net per month for 24 months (total €480) until April 30, 2021.
The requirements are:
But be careful, if in a certain month you do not meet the conditions (income or use of the cards), that month the bank does not pay the €20 and the client also loses the right to receive it in the following months even if they meet the requirements.
Bankinter offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents around €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you €350 directly, but that they pay you all that money for only €5,000 is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
The offer is valid until June 30, 2021
Up to €300 to clients residing in certain communities (see here)
€150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until June 30, 2021.
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In return he demands:
Among the good things about this entity:
Furthermore, if you open the checking account today you get €40 (see here) and then proceed to open the payroll account resulting in those €125 of interest.
Later when you become customers, the bank will continue to continually offer you new promotions.
ING gives you €50 if you open a payroll account and direct deposit a salary or pension into the account if you are invited by a friend and client of the bank, who will also take €50 (see more details here)
The advantages of the account are:
Furthermore, having the payroll account exempts you from paying commissions in the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

BBVA also has that limit.
In this sense Orange Bank to its clients and the changes will be effective from June 15 (Unicaja the same).
We have consulted the Bizum website, and it does not seem that the limits have changed, the same as always appears:
In any case, we think they are enough: 60 a month is like 2 a day, every day.
Bizum is a service to send and receive money instantly and without needing to know the Current Account, just the recipient's phone number.
In this way, it is a faster, more agile and friendly service than a bank transfer.
It also allows you to make online payments, and also payments in physical stores (members).
Furthermore, at the moment no bank affiliated with Bizum is going to charge for this service, although you never know in the future. Each bank can set rates and commissions just like any other banking service.
Yes, you can transfer money between your accounts instantly using Bizum.
The buts, that you need 2 mobile lines and for movements of a small amount of money (within the limits of Bizum).
Keep in mind that Bizum associates an account with a mobile number. Once configured (from the bank's APP), you can send money from one of your accounts (Mobile No. 1) to another of your accounts (Mobile No. 2).
In addition, the change (associating number to account) is done instantly, you can configure it according to your needs at all times.

In total, there were 11 main banks and another 3 that our users contributed at the time that we also included.
The advantages of each bank were described there, which we collect in this article in a comparative table; much more intuitive and easier to see the good in each one.
NOTE: we have eliminated Pibank from the list, because if this bank does not direct deposit a payroll, it does not give you a card nor does it allow direct deposit of receipts. It would be a Remunerated account at 0.5% APR (very interesting), but it would only be a savings account and there would be many more, such as Renaultbank (0.65% APR).
If you read us from your mobile phone, put it in landscape mode to see the following table, it will look much better. Thank you.
Entities that allow cash withdrawals at all ATMs have limitations: number of times or require a minimum amount.
There are entities that only allow withdrawals at their own ATMs and others have agreements with a wide network of ATMs. Check our ATM traffic light (here).
We consider that it has offices, if it has enough. Not like ING or Evo Banco whose number is very small. Openbank only has one office of its own, but you have all the Santander offices to withdraw money for free.
Other entities that have offices, but require payment of commissions if you want to operate in them (cost).
We consider that it does have offices, although it requires certain conditions, such as Abanca, which allows you to withdraw cash for amounts that cannot be done at an ATM.

Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.

Specifically, the changes to apply are:

Starting March 1, the bank will remunerate the first €5,000 at 1.51% APR, the same as until now, but if you have more than €5,000, each euro you add will be remunerated at 2.53% APR, without limit maximum.
Pibank will lower the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR next Wednesday, February 14.

Its great advantages, in addition to no commissions and no ties, are:
The downside is that it has very few offices (but there are more than practically the rest of the banks that, even if they have offices, do not allow you to go unless you pay).
The Banco Sabadell online bank offers a free account and debit card with free cash withdrawals at a wide network of ATMs.
CaixaBank's online bank (yes, CaixaBank), without commissions and without ties.
It offers the typical: account, cards, transfers and free bizum.
Also interesting are:

Yesterday it was BBVA's turn (see here), which starting June 15, 2021 will charge up to €160 in commissions unless you are linked: income, receipts and cards or loan or similar.
But don't think that there is no escape, and all banks are going to charge commissions unless you meet certain leonine conditions. Of course, you must forget about traditional banking and offices.
BBVA itself has a commission-free account, the Online Account, a digital account that does not allow you to go to an office or they charge you for the service (see more details here).

Additionally, your money is remunerated at 1% APR for the first €15,000 for 1 year. Then at 0.1% APR.
This entity, paradoxically part of the Santander group, offers its checking account with everything free (account, debit card, normal transfers and all Banco Santander ATMs can withdraw money) in exchange for nothing.
It is one of the few entities that allows you to go to an office (Santander) to withdraw cash (in addition to Santander ATMs) at no cost.
Additionally, if you are a new customer and open an account, the bank offers you an account for 6 months at 1% APR. If you also have a payroll, it will give you a 5% account for €5,000 for 6 months.
The entity offers a savings account that pays up to 0.2% APR (with payroll) or, if not, at a ridiculous interest of 0.05% APR.
This is another entity that gives you everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It also has the friend plan in which you can take up to €150 depending on the links you contract.
It is the most recommended entity and generates great trust among its clients. It also offers its Payroll Account for people who do not have a payroll. In exchange, it requires monthly income of at least €700 from another entity.
You will have an account, card and normal transfers at no cost, and you will be able to withdraw cash at a wide range of ATMs and even stores with your Twyp APP.
Additionally, if you have a payroll, the entity usually has the Amigo Plan, in which it gives you €50 (currently not in force).
It has the Orange account which is remunerated, but even more ridiculous than Openbank, at 0.01% APR.
We said about OrangeBank that it had the but of the FGD, here we would say the same: it is Dutch (we repeat, for many it is not a but but rather an advantage).
Bankinter also offers you an account without commissions, and without the need for payroll, but requires links:
And if you have a payroll, much easier:
The prize is not bad at all. Plus everything free. It pays you well during the first 2 years and for a maximum of €5,000
In total there are €350 of interest that the account can generate.
If you want an account without fees, cards, transfers and withdraw cash at any ATM in the world for free, you have to direct deposit a payroll or pension into Pibank.
If you don't do it, you will only have a paid account, although quite well paid, at 0.5% APR.
For us, they are all interesting, but we highlight:
They would use these accounts to operate, and the payroll would be free to move between the offers and promotions that existed at all times, such as Bankinter or Self Bank. We will publish a list shortly.
And you? Leave us a comment.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."

These new requirements will come into force exactly 6 months after the previous increase, on December 15, 2021 (see here).
The bank is communicating the new conditions to those affected and justifies it by ""the economic situation after the health crisis, as well as the evolution of the financial markets.""
To continue without commissions, you will have to have direct debit income, receipts and credit card use at least per month (1 of the alternatives).
The new accounts will be renamed “Election Account” and the Goodbye Commissions Program will no longer apply to these accounts (The changes do not affect the Online Account).
Until now your contract included an Administration commission and a Maintenance commission:
Commissions are collected quarterly and on March 15, June, September and December. If it is a holiday, the next business day will apply.
Additionally, if you meet variants 1 or 2:
The cards can be: Young Now BBVA, Young After BBVA, Now Blue BBVA, After Blue BBVA, Business Credit, Business Debit, Business Electron, Business Agrocoop BBVA, Classic Agrocoop, Now BBVA, After BBVA, Ábaco, Card 7, Business CX , Aqua Credit, Aqua Debit.

BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."

To obtain this number it is done through the REN0 program using, for example, a box from the 2019 Income Tax return, which this year is 505, the same as last year.
In addition, it will require your DNI, and the expiration date of your DNI, and if permanent, the date of issue.
With the reference number we can obtain the tax data, obtain the draft income tax, modify it and file the income tax return.
The reference number is a 6-digit number. Keep this reference number safe.
Although if you lose it, you can request it again, up to 10 numbers a day. Of course, you always have to use the last number, since every time a new one is generated, the previous one is no longer valid.
Box 505 can be obtained in 2 ways:
This year it will be difficult to go to the Tax Agency, at least for now due to the coronavirus confinement, but there are 3 alternatives:
In the old DNI, the location of this date is obvious, it appeared on the front and under the heading, ""EXPED.""

In the Electronic DNI or DNI 2.0 this date also appears, although ""very camouflaged.""
The Issue Date appears above where it says DNI NUMBER, within a kind of circle that looks blurry with 3 capital letters above it...

Example: Issue date: 221112 (Nov 22, 2012)
This date also appears on the DNI 3.0 and is also ""camouflaged.""
It is to the right of the front of the DNI above what they call CLI (Changing Laser Image).

When requesting the reference number, the date must be entered in the following format:
dd-mm-yyyy
Thus the date of the example would be: 11-22-2012.
If you have an account or deposit abroad, in addition to communicating its existence to the Bank of Spain and informing the Tax Agency, when filing your income tax return we must include the returns obtained from these products."

Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, with a 12-month term and 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

The €300 offer is only for the Communities of Madrid, Asturias, the Basque Country, Navarra and Rioja, the rest have to settle for half, €150.
In exchange, the bank asks:
This differential offer has bothered more than one user of our website, for example:
This offer will be valid until April 30, 2021 and as long as it is new direct debits.
For more information, call 91 090 07 97.
The ATMs available are Euro 6000, Bankia, Sabadell, Bankinter, Caja de Arquitectos and Caja Ingenieros, except in Galicia, where you can do it as many times as you want at any ABANCA ATM.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
900,Wizink continues to give 0.8% APR on its Deposits in April. No changes since August,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-sigue-en-abril-dando-al-08-tae-en-sus-depositos-sin-cambios-desde-agosto/,07/04/2021,"Wizink maintains its deposits unchanged in April 2021, offering a maximum profitability of 0.8% APR.
This interest rate was set in the month of August with a substantial drop:
In the month of August, the entity also cut the profitability of its savings account from 0.5% APR to 0.1% APR.
The good thing is that accounts opened before August 1st continue at 0.5% APR but only until April 30th. Starting May 1, it will be remunerated at 0.2% APR (see here).
Wizink Deposits

The characteristics of its deposits are:
The current features of this account are:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
901,Renault Bank lowers the profitability of its Tú+ Deposit to 0.85% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/renault-bank-baja-la-rentabilidad-de-su-depositu-tu-hasta-el-085-tae/,06/04/2021,"It hasn't even been running for 6 months and the first cut is underway. It affects your Tú+ Deposit for a 24-month term from 1% APR to 0.85% APR.
This entity has been operating in Spain since November 12, 2020 with 2 star products, the Contigo Account at 0.65% APR and the Tú+ Deposit, whose profitability has been cut by the bank.
In any case, both the account and its deposit are among the most profitable on the market, the penalty is the registration process.
People are having a lot of problems and customer service is practically non-existent: avalanche of customers? lack of foresight? both?
This entity is not new to us. Until now we have known it as RCI Banque, a French entity whose deposits could be contracted in Spain.
With this launch, the bank facilitates the contracting of its products directly through a website in Spanish and offering specific products for our country.
In addition, it now has a branch in Spain and therefore will apply personal income tax withholdings. Let's say it will work like ING in Spain, only the FGD is French.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.


Tomorrow, April 24, 2024, the marketing period for the account at 2.89% APR and 2-year deposit and 3.44% from Renault Bank ends.
The last extension was only 2 weeks, and if we already thought then that rates could be lowered, now it is even more likely.
Renault Bank has once again extended the contracting period for its products without changing its profitability: Account at 2.89% APR and deposit for 2 years and at 3.44% APR.
We congratulate our users who have been correct in their prediction with 67% of the votes (see here) stating that the bank would do that.
Next Wednesday, April 10, 2024, the marketing period for the Account at 2.89% APR and the deposit at 3.44% APR from Renault Bank ends. Will there be changes the next day?
What is your opinion? Answer us to the survey. Last time you got most of them right."
902,"This is how ING now sells its Orange Account, a savings account for Payroll Account clients",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/asi-vende-ahora-ing-su-cuenta-naranja-ahorran-clientes-de-cuenta-nomina/,05/04/2021,"We were interested in knowing how ING was going to sell its Orange Account starting April 1, which will have commissions if you do not meet its conditions.
Well, you can now see it on their website. It sells it as an account for its Payroll Account clients to save.
It also indicates that only one thing is needed: having a PAYROLL Account (Domiciling your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit or receiving income from another bank of at least €700 per month).
He says it is perfect for saving because:
All a bargain, but of course, it requires them to report everything, if you stop direct debiting your payroll, pension or unemployment benefit or receiving recurring income from another bank in your PAYROLL Account, you can continue with your ORANGE Account with some changes:
Be careful, clients who have a payroll account with monthly transfers... don't forget to carry out this operation every month if you have more than €30,000 in the Orange Account.
Compare with what the most profitable accounts on the market give:
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.5% APR and starting in May at 0.2% APR
*EBN maintains 0.3% APR for former clients, and as of May 1, it will drop to 0.15% APR


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
903,Holy Thursday “Gift” from ING and MyInvestor,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/regalo-de-jueves-santo-de-ing-y-myinvestor/,30/03/2021,"ING and MyInvestor are giving away a stick to their clients or a portion of their clients for Easter. Both entities have agreed to make the changes on April 1, Holy Thursday.
In the case of ING, it will begin to charge commissions to 4% of its clients. Those who have more than €30,000 in the Orange Account and have not contracted their Payroll Account.
On the other hand, MyInvestor will slash the profitability of your account for former clients who have been with the bank for more than 1 year, which will drop from 1% APR to 0.1% APR.
ING will charge a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of for the Dutch entity.
This change will affect 4% of its clients who will have to meet certain conditions or from April 1, ING will charge them €10 commission per month.
The way to avoid these commissions is easy, you just have to do 1 of the following 2 things:
The Orange Account will continue without commissions, without limits and is remunerated at 0.01% APR:
The bank does not allow you to have €30,000 or more in the Orange account if you do not have the payroll account and meet the conditions.
If you have less, there are no commissions, nor does it require you to have a payroll account, but the Orange Account is not remunerated (0% APR).
Customers who have been with the entity for more than 1 year will suffer a cut in the interest rate on their account as of April 1. It will go from the current 1% APR to 0.1% APR.
Customers with less than 1 year of service and new customers will continue to enjoy the 1% APR, but only until they have been a customer for one year. Afterwards they will also charge only 0.1% APR.
If you decide to take the money, do so the day after you drop to 0.1% APR. This way you take advantage of the 1% APR profitability all the time.
If you want to close the account, wait for the interest to be collected to avoid problems. We understand that it is the 10th of each month. In any case, the account has no fees, so there is no urgency to cancel the account.
Cancellation is simple. You must send an email to info@myinvestor.es with the following information/documents:
The email must be sent from the email address you have registered with the bank.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.

But this predominance goes beyond its simple name, also in terms of marketing and product policy.
This weekend, the Bankia website has withdrawn the On Account, Bankia's online, commission-free account, the entity's most interesting account.
The information for this account is still in Google's cache, but on the entity's website it redirects you to the list of accounts for individuals.
The bank will have to notify existing clients at least 2 months in advance to make changes.
Most likely, they will become ImaginBank clients, which is also commission-free, but you will have to download their APP.
>> See more details of the possible changes
The characteristics of the ON account are:
Demands:
Of course, withdrawals over €600 can be made over the counter, as well as depositing checks without losing the benefits of the On Account.
If you do not maintain the digital profile, the card will no longer be free (Registration and renewal fee: €20). If you operate in offices, account maintenance and transfer fees will be charged until the next settlement.
Logically, the account is not remunerated; and its contracting must be carried out in the Customer Area of ​​your electronic banking.


CaixaBank will carry out the technological integration with Bankia between Friday, November 12, and Sunday, November 14, 2021.
There will also be more commissions for Bankia customers: for the card and for the On Account
As we said a few days ago, Caixa Bank will eliminate the Bankia On Account and all its conditions and they will be transferred to the Day to Day Account with payment of up to €240 commission if you do not join (see here).
But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year.
CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022."
905,ImaginBank ends its friend plan before the stipulated deadline,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/imaginbank-pone-fin-a-su-plan-amigo-antes-del-plazo-estipulado/,29/03/2021,"During the last few days we were receiving questions from our users about the Amigo Plan and that apparently it was no longer in force.
We have contacted the entity and that is how it is. The bank has closed the plan before the stipulated deadline, April 30, 2021. We do not know the reasons.
This promotion, whose conditions are clearly stated and could be consulted by all customers in their APP, began on March 3, 2021 and would last until April 30, 2021.
The only event that has interrupted this campaign that we know of is the update of its APP (see here).
We do not know what the cause-effect is: if said update caused the interruption or if you wanted to end the campaign by updating the application.
This is a campaign that offers a €20 bonus to new customers who open an account with the entity through the recommendation of a customer.
The existing client/sponsor does not leave empty-handed, he/she receives a €5 bonus.
Be careful, we say that you have to be a new customer of both ImaginBank and CaixaBank.
The process is very simple:
In about 15 days you will receive your bonus (€20) in your account.
It's strange, but it is a CaixaBank Online office that has exactly the opposite of what the physical bank offers:
Furthermore, it has no permanence. So if you want to get the €20 and then close the account, you have no penalty.
Of course, you cannot go to an office to carry out procedures, it will cost you money.


In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because he wants to or because he is too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:
Banks are increasingly demanding more from their clients to exempt them from commissions. It's a competition to see who will charge the most (up to €240, see here).
Some (Santander) have already realized that this is not viable and have made some changes to their Account 123 and launched an Online Account without commissions and without links in the style of the BBVA Online account"

In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because he wants to or because he is too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:
Banks are increasingly demanding more from their clients to exempt them from commissions. It's a competition to see who will charge the most (up to €240, see here).
Some (Santander) have already realized that this is not viable and have made some changes to their Account 123 and launched an Online Account without commissions and without links in the style of the BBVA Online account"
907,"Bankia customers, these can be your commissions now that you are from CaixaBank",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/clientes-de-bankia-estas-pueden-ser-tus-comisiones-ahora-que-eres-de-caixabank/,26/03/2021,"Today the merger between Bankia and CaixaBank becomes effective, and the resulting bank will be CaixaBank. What is not known is whether all of CaixaBank's policies will be imposed, especially regarding the issue of commissions.
Bankia in this sense is less abusive (see here) in terms of what it charges clients and if CaixaBank's strategy is imposed you should prepare yourself.
These new conditions cannot apply to you if you live in one of the 86 locations where there are competition problems, although it is only temporary. They will maintain the conditions for 3 years and then they will give you the stick (see here).
As for the rest of the clients, the bank CANNOT change the conditions if it does not notify you at least 60 days in advance for individuals and the self-employed, and 30 days for the rest of the clients (companies, associations...).
It is not a lot of time so you have to be attentive and prepare everything for the change if necessary.
As of October 1, 2020, the bank required compliance with the following 2 conditions:

If you only meet the first condition, the bank will charge you €15 in commission quarterly (€60 per year).
If you do not meet any of the conditions, the commission amounts to €60 per quarter (€240 per year).
Oh, and be careful, you can only operate through their digital channels or at ATMs, since if you do it in their offices, they will charge you 2 euros per operation (Those over 65 years of age can carry out 4 free operations per month).
Of course, you get rid of commissions if you have one of the following accounts:
Oh, it also offers a free account to holders under 26 and new customers for the first year.
NOTE: The products to take into account for the €20,000 are: investment funds, fund portfolios, structured funds, managed portfolios, savings insurance and individual pension plans.
1. Online accounts without commissions.
Both entities have one of those accounts: Cuanta ON from Bankia and ImaginBank from CaixaBank. Everything indicates that ImaginBank will predominate, which is commission-free, at least for the moment.
2. FGD.
By merging, it is now just a single entity. Make sure you only have €100,000 in this bank.
3. Account numbering
It could undergo a change. Although you should not worry. They must take care of all the procedures: receipts, direct debits. Of course, be careful when you are going to transfer money to that account.
Once done, it's a bit of a hassle to recover it afterwards (see here)


CaixaBank will carry out the technological integration with Bankia between Friday, November 12, and Sunday, November 14, 2021.
There will also be more commissions for Bankia customers: for the card and for the On Account
As we said a few days ago, Caixa Bank will eliminate the Bankia On Account and all its conditions and they will be transferred to the Day to Day Account with payment of up to €240 commission if you do not join (see here).
But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year.
CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022."
908,CaixaBank will not be able to change the conditions of Bankia customers in 86 locations,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/caixabank-no-podra-cambias-las-condiciones-de-los-clientes-de-bankia-en-86-localidades/,25/03/2021,"The merger between CaixaBank and Bankia will become a reality tomorrow, March 26, and will affect all its clients in one way or another, especially Bankia clients.
With the merger, according to the CNMC, there will be a risk of monopoly in 86 locations: 21 postal codes as the only bank present and 65 postal codes with a duopoly.
In this way, the supervisory body has imposed a series of conditions on the entity resulting from the merger:
Additionally, for all clients, the new bank must communicate the changes in commissions derived from the merger:
The merger also affects third-party clients, such as the clients of ING, banks with Euro 6000 and Banco Sabadell with which Bankia had an agreement to use ATMs:
The FGD covers €100,000 per person and entity. Until now, you could have €100,000 in Bankia and another €100,000 in CaixaBank; in total €200,000 under the umbrella of the FGD.
With the merger, by becoming a single bank, it will only cover €100,000 per person, and anything above that amount would be outside the FGD. In the example case, half of your money.
The entity resulting from the merger will have 20 million clients with more than 330,000 million euros in deposits, which represents almost a quarter of all deposits.
The consequences will be more or less the same:
Both Bankia (€168) and CaixaBank (€240) charge commissions for their accounts if you DO NOT join.
In this merger it seems that CaixaBank and its commissions will predominate, so pay attention to Bankia customers.
CaixaBank will carry out the technological integration with Bankia between Friday, November 12, and Sunday, November 14, 2021.
There will also be more commissions for Bankia customers: for the card and for the On Account

909,Bankinter will eliminate the 0.2% APR profitability of the COINC account in 2 months,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bankinter-elimina-en-2-meses-la-rentabilidad-del-02-tae-de-la-cuenta-coinc/,25/03/2021,"Bankinter is informing its COINC Account clients that within 2 months the profitability of said account will go to 0% APR (without remuneration).
Bankinter began the integration of the COINC Account into its platform in November 2019 and was completed in February 2020. Since then, it has maintained the profitability of 0.2% APR for its clients without changes.
Yesterday, the bank began sending a statement to its clients eliminating account profitability, which will take effect on May 24, 2021.
The entity justifies this decrease due to the current situation of interest rates, but that is not something new, we have been at 0 rate for years.
The account no longer makes sense, since it is a savings account that will now be without remuneration.
The profitability history of this account is worth seeing.
It started at 4% APR in July 2012 and remained at that rate until January 2013.
The entity has been progressively lowering the interest rate to the current 0.2% APR, and in 2 months it will stop paying.
It has long been one of the most profitable products on the market, even more so than long-term deposits.
Dear Mr. xxx: We are contacting you to inform you that, due to the current situation of interest rates, we will proceed to eliminate the current remuneration of your COINC account, becoming 0%APR. This modification will become effective two months after receipt of this communication.
Consent to this contractual modification, in accordance with the provisions of the Payment Services Law, will be considered tacitly granted by you if, prior to its entry into force, you do not express your opposition to said modification. On the contrary, if you express your disagreement with the new established conditions, you may terminate your contract at no cost.
If you need any clarification, you can go to your Bankinter Office, contact your Agent or Personal Manager or also call Bankinter Telephone Banking at 91 657 88 00.
We thank you for the trust you have placed in Bankinter and we reiterate our total commitment to care and service.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."
910,The real reason why ING will start charging commissions and + commissions?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/la-verdadera-razon-por-la-que-ing-comenzara-a-cobrar-comisiones-y-comisiones/,24/03/2021,"As of April 1, 2021, it will be the date set for ING to stop being the commission-free bank. Because if you are not careful, you will have to pay €10 a month, that is, €120 a year.
We know that it is easy, very easy to avoid commissions at ING. You only have to meet one of the following 2 conditions:
But it charges commissions, and surely there are some clueless people who fall into the trap (4% of its clients will have to do something if they don't want to pay). But the worst thing is that it gets people used to that, that it may charge them commissions.
There have been such unthinkable things at ING that the bank has been subtly introducing that now seems normal to us:
Indeed, everything on the list had ING before. And what will come. Well, its CEO for Spain Ignacio Juliá said it, that we must get used to paying for services.
At the moment, they will charge the Orange Account if you deposit more than €30,000, as if that were a service... but they consider it that way.
They (all banks) try to spread the idea that by putting our money in their accounts they are keeping it for us, in which case it would be a service, but it is a lie (see here). They do not put it in a safe, nor do they put it in the ECB, they use it to provide mortgages at 2%, loans at 5% or 10% and card credits of up to 20%.
Afterwards, will you charge for the Payroll Account? The transfers? the cards? direct debit receipts?…
After eliminating all these advantages, ING in 2020 has broken records in customer acquisition. It added 200,000 new clients to its Payroll account, reaching 2.5 million users.
The unfortunate thing is that it is not entirely due to the merit of ING, but rather due to the demerit of other banks such as Santander, BBVA, Sabadell, CaixaBank, Sabadell and countless others, which do nothing but stab their clients.
To this we add that the bank obtained much lower profits than the previous year, 39% below the 2019 data. It has turned on the light bulb for its bosses... to charge commissions to earn more. Logical.
From here we want to open your eyes. ING has been the best, it has changed the issue of commissions in banks, it has done many good things for savers. But that's the past.
Now you must value it for what it is, a bank that wants to make money like everyone else, and if we react, perhaps it will back down. He already did it with the issue of the mandatory APP to operate with ING (see here).


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
911,"Get ready for more fees at ING: it says the same as the big banks, ains…",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/preparate-para-mas-comisiones-en-ing-dice-lo-mismo-que-los-grandes-bancos-ains/,23/03/2021,"The CEO of ING for Spain and Portugal, Ignacio Juliá, has said that clients must get used to paying for the value-added services provided by banking entities.
Oh my goodness, the same thing that big banks like Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank or Bankia say.
How ING has changed over time! From the bank without commissions, where your money only grows to what can come and will come from April 1.
We have been denouncing that ING was changing for years and every time we publish something, they attack us (see history of articles about ING)
One of the clearest times was when we talked about Germany beginning to charge for the account and deposits. Many said it was nonsense, but there you have it. From April 1, ING will charge €10 for the Orange Account if you do not have a payroll account and deposit more than €30,000 in the account.
Now one of the bosses at ING says that we should get used to the commissions, and that it will continue to ""adapt to the environment"", and what will come next, that they will charge, unless we react and tell them that enough is enough. Which is becoming just anyone.
It's the same old story, when it was new everything was rosy, and when it becomes big and dominant in the market, it does whatever it wants. And the worst of all is that there are still people who defend it as if it were the ING of a few years ago.
For us it was the best bank without a doubt, but over the years it has lost many things, and as of April 1, the worst, the bank symbol without commissions.
As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
The orange entity will charge a €10 commission to its clients who have the Orange Account and who are not also clients of the Payroll Account and deposit more than €30,000 in the account.
The bank communicated this decision to its clients in November 2020, breaking an impeccable and benchmark record of NO COMMISSIONS.
If you are a client of the Orange Account, you can avoid these commissions through one of the following 2 conditions:
The Orange Account will continue without commissions, without limits and is remunerated at 0.01% APR:
The bank does not allow you to have €30,000 or more in the Orange account if you do not have the payroll account and meet the conditions.
If you have less, there are no commissions, nor does it require you to have a payroll account, but the Orange Account is not remunerated (0% APR).


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120

912,What investments/sectors are benefiting from COVID?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/que-inversiones-sectores-se-estan-beneficiando-del-covid/,23/03/2021,"The coronavirus pandemic has been a hard blow for the population: loss of freedoms, changes in habits and customs, but also for the economy, especially affecting the tourism sector, commerce, restaurants, and the economy in general.
But it has not been negative for all sectors, and if you have been skillful in your investments you may have achieved great benefits, and in fact you can still take advantage of the situation for the future.
In 2020 it has been a race in the production of products to fight the coronavirus: masks, gloves, appropriate protective equipment for healthcare personnel, PCRs, antigen tests, vaccines...
Some investment funds such as Ibercaja Sanidad or Caixabank Multisalud obtained significant profits in 2020 and it seems that they will continue this path in 2021.
All of these companies will play an important role in the coming months and their evolution will continue to be positive as long as the pandemic lasts, and perhaps even beyond in time, because COVID has changed some of our habits.
The coronavirus has brought working conditions dreamed of by many and demanded by social agents: teleworking, thus helping to reconcile family life. Telemedicine, online meetings, etc. are also being implemented.
The most likely thing is that many of these conditions are here to stay, because the bosses, politicians and bosses who viewed them with bad eyes have realized that they work.
All of this implies greater use of communication networks, increased sales of technological products, greater use of social networks, and online services. As an example, Telefónica earned 38.5% more in 2020 than in 2019, reaching a net profit of 1,582 million.
Online entertainment consumption has also skyrocketed: pay TV, YouTube, mobile games, etc.
If Amazon or Aliexpress were already large companies that did not stop growing, with confinement and the closure of businesses, they have skyrocketed.
Amazon earned 88.9 billion dollars (76.326 million euros) during the pandemic, 40% more than in 2019. They have been the highest profits since it existed.
Investing in these companies is a good idea even in the long term. Anyone who tries the convenience of shopping from home will surely continue to do so, all to the detriment of physical commerce.
The increase in e-commerce has benefited logistics companies. It is estimated that these companies have experienced growth of between 50% and 60%.
In any scenario there are opportunities to obtain benefits. You can invest in a company that has adapted to the new situation or even start a business yourself in the indicated sectors.
Furthermore, it is not necessary to be a large company or require a large investment. A simple Youtuber (spending and investment almost 0) now has more opportunities than the pre-covid era.

913,Bizum from Orange Bank now allows you to donate to NGOs and send and request money from several people at the same time,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bizum-de-orange-bank-permite-ahora-donar-a-ong-y-enviar-y-solicitar-dinero-a-varios-a-la-vez/,23/03/2021,"Oragen Bank has improved its Bizum service by now being able to make donations to NGOs and also send and request money from several users at the same time according to a statement that the bank has sent to its clients.
These features are included in the latest update of the Orange Bank APP that you can download from Google Play or the Apple Store.
Bizum is a system to send and receive money immediately from mobile to mobile without needing to know bank account numbers. (see here), which Orange Bank began to offer to its clients at the beginning of 2021, and 2 months later it receives its first improvement.
The entity seems to be here to stay, because in addition to offering good profitability, it provides many interesting services, all of which are free.
The account offers a Spanish IBAN but under the French FGD and has a limited maximum amount to be paid:
It is also giving a €25 bonus to new customers who link their card with a payment application and use it (see here).
Orange Bank allows you to send money immediately through free immediate transfers for a maximum of €15,000 per operation.
The only difference with respect to Bizum is that it requires knowing the recipient's account number.
The entity allows you to withdraw cash from any ATM in the EU without commissions. Of course, it is limited to 3 operations per month, which we believe is enough.
It is necessary to be an Orange customer to register with OrangeBank, which is of little concern because there is a free way (see here).
The bank confirmed that there are no problems (see here)
At the end of 2021, it will not be necessary to be an Orange customer to register, as indicated by the bank a few months ago.


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."
914,Lowering in MyInvestor from 1% to 0.1% APR on April 1. Leave? As? Alternatives?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/bajada-en-myinvestor-del-1-a-01-tae-el-1-de-abril-me-voy-como/,22/03/2021,"Starting next April 1, the accounts of the majority of former MyInvestor clients will begin to pay 0.1% APR, so many will consider moving to another bank.
When to do it? How to do it? Options? That is what we are going to tell you below.
It depends on your seniority. The bank guarantees all its clients 1 year at 1% APR. Thus, if on April 1 you have been a client:
If you decide to take the money the day after dropping to 0.1% APR. This way you take advantage of the 1% APR profitability all the time.
Some clients will be on April 1 and others later.
Don't try to leave that same day. You must wait for interest to be collected to avoid problems. We understand that it is the 10th of each month. In any case, the account has no fees, so there is no urgency to cancel the account.
The process is simple, now. Before, we had to send a postal letter, but the bank has informed us that it is not necessary, with an email to info@myinvestor.es with the following data/documents:
The email must be sent from the email address you have registered with the bank.
There are other accounts that give more than the 0.1% APR that MyInvestor will offer. The most interesting due to its profitability is undoubtedly Orange Bank:
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.5% APR and starting in May at 0.2% APR
*EBN maintains 0.3% APR for former clients, and as of May 1, it will drop to 0.15% APR


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

The start period for the promotion began on February 23, 2021, and what was going to last until the end of the year, the bank has lowered it until June 30.
If you are a customer and want to sponsor new accounts, you must enter your electronic banking, both web and mobile APP, in the ""invite a friend"" section.
In this section you can see your promotion code to be a godfather, which you must share with your friends and family so that they can use it during the process of registering the BBVA Online account, along with the Aqua card.
The godson will also have to use the Aqua card to pay for a purchase for an amount equal to or greater than 15 euros within a maximum period of 3 months from registration.
Payment of bonuses will be made once compliance with the previous points is verified.
BBVA allows you to sponsor a maximum of 10 new clients, so you can earn a total of €50.
NOTE: if you want to be a godfather or godson, leave a comment below.
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, it can be contracted, but with some disadvantages (debit card with cost?).


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
916,Forex and Covid: The impact of vaccination on currency markets,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/guias/forex-y-covid-el-impacto-de-la-vacunacion-en-los-mercados-de-divisas/,19/03/2021,"Investing in currencies is an activity that is not suitable for all investors due to its high volatility, but if you are well instructed you can take advantage of the market fluctuations to achieve succulent profits.
There are many factors that can cause very large fluctuations in its price, as has happened in the last year with the coronavirus pandemic.
A political decision or influential economic news can cause important changes, which if you anticipate, you can achieve great rewards, and if you invest in Forex, the effects are multiplied by the leverage.
With Forex you can multiply the profits (also the risk) by allowing you to invest more money than you have and it is thanks to the fact that the brokers grant you a temporary loan that allows you to operate with funds greater than those that may be available at a specific time.

The Coronavirus has been worldwide, but depending on which country it reached before or after, the quotes of currency pairs fluctuated strongly. Logically, there are also other factors that can alter its value.
But if we look at the Euro/Dollar, we see that the Euro was losing value with respect to the Dollar in the months before the pandemic and in the month of March-April (beginning of the pandemic), it began to turn around.

As events unfolded, the different waves of contagion on both sides of the pond impacted its value.
What remains ahead is who will get the most vaccines (it has existed since December 2020) and when their population will be immunized against the virus. Whoever does it better, their currency will strengthen and if you are an investor you should bet on that currency.
As you can see in the graph, it is clear that the US is doing better or the EU is doing worse. At this time, 20% of the US population has already been vaccinated, while only 7.5% in the EU.
Furthermore, the announcements of delays in the delivery of vaccines do not help the Euro at all. So everything indicates that if you are an investor you should bet on the Dollar. But as we say, any news can change radically.
NOTE: we are not recommending you buy dollars, much less invest in Forex. It is a simple relationship that we have seen between the evolution of the Euro/Dollar and the pandemic.

917,The ImaginBank Friend Plan is back: €20 bonus for new customers,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/vuelve-el-plan-amigo-imaginbank-20e-de-bonificacion-para-el-nuevo-cliente/,18/03/2021,"ImaginBank had its friend plan in effect until December 31, 2020, but they have relaunched it.
This is a campaign that offers a €20 bonus to new customers who open an account with the entity through the recommendation of a customer.
The existing client/sponsor does not leave empty-handed, he/she receives a €5 bonus.
Be careful, we say that you have to be a new customer of both ImaginBank and CaixaBank.
The process is very simple:
In about 15 days you will receive your bonus (€20) in your account.
Don't worry, he doesn't have to be your real friend. There are many people on the Internet who offer to be your friend.
If you want with a code or if you are a customer and want to offer yourself as a friend, leave a comment below.
It's strange, but it is a CaixaBank Online office that has exactly the opposite of what the physical bank offers:
Furthermore, it has no permanence. So if you want to get the €20 and then close the account, you have no penalty.
Of course, you cannot go to an office to carry out procedures, it will cost you money.


In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because he wants to or because he is too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:
Banks are increasingly demanding more from their clients to exempt them from commissions. It's a competition to see who will charge the most (up to €240, see here).
Some (Santander) have already realized that this is not viable and have made some changes to their Account 123 and launched an Online Account without commissions and without links in the style of the BBVA Online account"
918,"Do you have a commission-free account with no conditions at BBVA? Yes, even if it seems incredible",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/cuenta-sin-comisiones-y-sin-condiciones-en-bbva-si-aunque-prezca-increible/,17/03/2021,"Yes, it seems incredible, but BBVA does offer an account without commissions and without conditions, which not even ING could boast of in a few days (April 1).
Although it is not entirely true, it is true that there are no commissions and no conditions. Ask for:
The bank offers you:
How to say, you should not go to their offices, because you will have to pay commissions. But hey, if you have a tight situation you can do it.
The account allows up to 2 holders, and the best thing is its card, one of the most advanced to avoid fraud (card fraud, see here):
This is the Aqua card.
Yes of course. It already has 1 drawback: according to its website, the account is only for new clients. Although we know that current clients have been able to sign up for the account. The bad thing is that they have to pay by card.
The other is not currently there, but knowing BBVA, the conditions of this account could change at any time. But hey, for now it's a good account.
>> See more information about the account and the card.
We don't think it affects our readers, but it has to be said.
This entity, like ING, will charge a commission if you keep a lot of money in the bank.
Specifically, it will charge 0.025% monthly for the balance that exceeds €100,000. That is, a negative interest rate of -0.3% APR.
This commission will be applied if the client has no connection with the bank: without a payroll or other products.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
919,The best and most profitable savings accounts of the month of March 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-mejores-cuentas-ahorro-y-mas-rentables-del-mes-de-marzo-de-2021/,16/03/2021,"This will be the last month that all MyInvestor clients enjoy their 1% APR and up to €15,000.
The bank announced in January that this remuneration will be welcome only and will last 1 year (see here).
Former clients will be charged 0.1% APR starting in April, unless they have NOT been with the entity for 1 year. In this case, it will continue at 1% APR until one year of being a bank customer.
In the month of May there will also be changes for EBN and Wizink with cuts that will affect former clients of the entity.
That 0.1% is very little low compared to other entities.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.5% APR and starting in May at 0.2% APR
*EBN maintains 0.3% APR for former clients, and as of May 1, it will drop to 0.15% APR
It is the most profitable thing that can be achieved now in a savings account, the bad thing is that it can only be contracted by customers with an Orange mobile line (at the end of 2021 it will no longer be necessary), although it is not a big problem either, you can become a customer of prepaid (we have done it and it has involved no cost).
Furthermore, once you register, you do not have to continue being an Orange customer. You can throw away the orange card.
The account offers a Spanish IBAN but under the French FGD and has a limited maximum amount to be paid:
It is also giving a €25 bonus to new customers who link their card with a payment application and use it (see here).
It is the most profitable and under the Spanish FGD, the bad thing is that it is limited to the first €15,000, but as we say it is only during the first year that you become a customer.
Once this period has passed, the remuneration is only 0.1% APR.
The account characteristics are:
Entity that begins to operate in Spain today with the opening of an online branch (Spanish IBAN). It will be the same as ING in its beginnings.
It will offer a high-yield savings account and deposit under the French FGD:
Under the Spanish FGD. This is the online branch of Banco Pichincha, offering 0.2 percentage points more than its physical banking. Be careful, that can change:
It also has deposits of up to 0.8% APR. Furthermore, if you open the payroll account you would have all the services.
With Spanish FGD, Wizink offers 0.5% APR on accounts opened before August 1, 2020, but from May 1 at 0.2% APR
NN Bank plans to lower the profitability of its account to 0.3% APR on January 21, 2021 (see details here)
This account is under the Dutch FGD:
This is the only account with a foreign IBAN. The money is in Holland and is not subject to withholding. The client must declare the interest in the income tax return.
Furthermore, since the money is abroad, if you have more than €50,000 outside of Spain you have to complete form 720 annually.
Since July, EBN offers its account at 0.15% APR (for former clients it continues at 90.3% APR until April 30) under the Spanish FGD.
It usually has high-profit deposits, but its marketing is now suspended.
It is the same as Pibank, but with offices and lower profitability.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
920,"Facto Deposits: from the best, to any one and now to irrelevant, at 0.01% APR",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/depositos-facto-de-los-mejores-a-uno-cualquier-y-ahora-a-irrelevante-al-001-tae/,15/03/2021,"Facto has offered during 2020 one of the most profitable deposits on the market, reaching up to 1.25% APR.
In the month of November 202, things changed, profitability dropped and the maximum it offered was 0.6% APR and only for terms of up to 179 days, becoming a normal deposit with the competition offering more than double.
…and next Wednesday, the bank will cut the interest rate again and deposits will become irrelevant: at 0.01% APR.
In this sense, the bank is communicating to its clients, assuring them that the deposits already contracted will not change their conditions, as it could not be otherwise.
If you are interested in these products, you have today and tomorrow to contract your deposits at the current rates.

Days
The entity now offers a maximum of 0.6% APR up to 179 days and for longer terms, 0.42% APR.
The characteristics of its products are:
These products are covered by Italy's FGD. The entity has a branch in Spain and makes personal income tax withholdings.



Facto has informed its clients that as of January 6, 2024, a new decrease in the profitability of all their deposits will come into effect.
This decrease will especially affect the longer terms, starting at 1 year, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points.
While the shortest terms, those of less than 1 year, will see their profitability cut by 0.25 percentage points.
Facto has informed clients of the reduction from 4% APR to 3.75% APR on deposits from 93 to 179 days starting tomorrow.
Thus, it will only leave the terms of 90, 91 and 92 days at 4% APR, more specifically at 4.06% APR (4% TIN).
If yesterday we said that there are signs of lower rates (see here), today Facto confirms it with a significant drop in all its fixed-term deposits.
In this sense, it is communicating to its clients and the new rates will come into force tomorrow, December 13, 2023. The previous rates still appear on its website."
921,"March 2021, the last month of ING as a bank WITHOUT COMMISSIONS.",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/marzo-2021-el-ultimo-mes-de-ing-como-banco-sin-comisiones/,12/03/2021,"As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
The orange entity will charge a €10 commission to its clients who have the Orange Account and who are not also clients of the Payroll Account and deposit more than €30,000 in the account.
The bank communicated this decision to its clients in November 2020, breaking an impeccable and benchmark record of NO COMMISSIONS.
If you are a client of the Orange Account, you can avoid these commissions through one of the following 2 conditions:
The Orange Account will continue without commissions, without limits and is remunerated at 0.01% APR:
The bank does not allow you to have €30,000 or more in the Orange account if you do not have the payroll account and meet the conditions.
If you have less, there are no commissions, nor does it require you to have a payroll account, but the Orange Account is not remunerated (0% APR).
We know that complying with ING's new conditions is very easy to follow commissions, but the cost of losing what you have earned (and paid) so much for so many years (ad after ad) was truly so high.
It is a stupid decision by the bank, because all of us who know ING associate it with NO COMMISSIONS, which will be lost now.
But the decision really only affects 171,000 clients who currently have more than €30,000. Only 4% of their total clients.
Logically, they will withdraw their money and leave it below €30,000. In the end the bank will not charge anything, and will lose that immaculate NO COMMISSION condition.
The entity, of course, avoids the ""unusual economic moment in which interest rates (which set the price of money) are falling relentlessly,"" having been ""negative for years.""
This situation, says the bank, ""forces it to make some changes to our ORANGE Account.""
For more information, INRI says that ING was born ""as a savings bank"" and that is why it has always ""bet on giving your savings the highest profitability that the market allowed us"", which due to the ""negative rates forces us to take this measure."" ».
>> See Bank statement
The only true thing he has said is that it was born as a bank for your savings, but it stopped being that way a long time ago, and we have been saying it for a long time.
We have also said that negative rates do not mean that they do not have to remunerate our money. In fact, you can see entities in the market that give 1% APR in a savings account like ING's:
Furthermore, that does not explain the reason for charging €10 per month or €120 per year for having more than €30,000 in the bank.
Where do you get that cost from? Could it be that they want to profit? Or simply coerce your clients to sign up for the payroll account?
It is true that if the bank puts all the clients' money in the ECB it costs them more than €120 per year per client with more than €30,000 (-0.5% annually), but as we have already said more than once; nor is it mandatory to do that, if in fact no bank does it.
They only deposit a small part (they currently deposit 5% in the ECB), which will indeed have a cost, but it cannot even remotely reach €120 per client. I recommend you read: the lies of the banks to justify the possible charge for deposits.
We did not believe that ING was going to do what the big banks like Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank or Bankia say. The truth is that every day he looks more like them.
We reiterate: how we miss the ING of a few years ago….


Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are, but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost.
But we tell you how to stay in the bank.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.
We tell you a way to get rid of commissions in these cases.
A bank has you tied up and now it is raising the account fees. There is a way to get rid of commissions.
If you have an account for exclusive use of that bondage, you cannot be charged anything."
922,"Today, Santander charges commission for the ""day to day"" for the 2nd time, and on the 15th, for the 1st time for ""Zero 123""",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/hoy-santander-cobra-por-2a-vez-comision-a-los-de-dia-a-dia-y-el-15-por-1a-vez-a-zero-123/,11/03/2021,"Today, Banco Santander has charged up to €20 commission for the second time to customers who had the Day to Day Account and who were transferred to the Santander One Account.
Next, Monday, March 15, it will charge for the first time those who had Account Zero 123 and who are still in the entity.
In addition, on March 18, it will charge for the second time those who had Account 123, and have not accepted the new conditions of Santander One.
This is so, because the bank unified its accounts in 3 steps:
The entity has so far notified its clients of charging commissions for the first time in their new Santander One account.
It depends on the links you have with the bank. The bank defines 4 types of relationships/customer profiles for Santander One.
1. Income and payment links:
2. Product Links
3. Shareholders (1,000 bank shares)
4. Select Clients or private banking.
Depending on your links, you will have to pay more or less:
The bank establishes 3 possibilities:
Fulfilling one of the 2:
If you are a customer and want to continue, enter your links and we will tell you what they will charge you or what else you have to do to avoid having to pay commissions:

Enter your current relationships with Banco Santander: Payroll or Pension Pack: €600 Income: €600 Pension: €600 Self-Employed Fees: €175 CAP: €3,000----------------- ---------------------Receipts: 3 quarterlyUse cards: 6 quarterlyPack BSantander Products: €20,000*Santander Shares €10,000*OthersLoan, Mortgage or RentingLife, home or car insurance : 10€Monthly commissionsZero account 12312€sSantander One20€sExtra links for NO COMMISSIONS:Payroll, Pension or Income or self-employed or PAC3 quarterly receipts6 quarterly card usesSavings or Financing or Protection*Santander One requires only €5,000 in savings products*Santander One requires only 1,000 Santander shares See other calculators Powered by www.tucapital.es, the website for the best bank deposits
Extra links for NO COMMISSIONS:

*Santander One requires only €5,000 in savings products
*Santander One requires only 1,000 Santander shares

This would be the most sensible decision. Leave a bank that has offered a lot (well used), but now will charge you double.
There are many alternatives:
The first thing you have to collect is the information of all the receipts that you have direct deposited in the Santander account to move it to another bank.
To change, there are 2 alternatives:
You can leave any bank by porting in the style of telephone companies.
You go to the recipient bank where you want to take the things, you fill out a form with everything and it will take care of everything. You don't have to do anything else, you don't even have to set foot in a Santander office.
The danger is that you will not be able to protest if Santander charges you any commission (in the process). It will come in the liquidation.
Furthermore, it is possible that during the process a problem arises (stocks, credit cards) and the account is not closed correctly or on time, so you will be charged a commission starting next Monday.

Before going to the bank you have to:

The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

Given this circumstance, the entity has made extraordinary provisions of 61 million, in addition to the 200 million last year to face the Supreme Court ruling on revolving cards (see here).
In the accounts for 2020, the 14 million euros of ERE on 123 workers are included
The entity claims to have a high solvency ratio, highlighting its CET1 'phased-in' ratio of 18.1%, that is, 428 basis points above regulatory requirements.
It seems almost strange these days for a bank to say in a press release that they finance themselves with customer deposits.
Furthermore, it does not give just anything, but rather offers one of the most profitable deposits on the market, and others wanting to charge for deposits such as BBVA or ING (see here).
…And hence, in the second and third quarters of 2020, the entity increased the profitability of its deposits, offering up to 1.65% APR, to capture or retain the money of its clients.
Wizink maintains its deposits unchanged in March 2021, offering a maximum profitability of 0.8% APR.
This interest rate was set in the month of August with a substantial drop:
In the month of August, the entity also cut the profitability of its savings account from 0.5% APR to 0.1% APR.
The good thing is that accounts opened before August 1st continue at 0.5% APR but only until April 30th. Starting May 1, it will be remunerated at 0.2% APR (see here).
The characteristics of its deposits are:
The current features of this account are:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.
Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

3. No commissions (zero commission plan).
Meet the following 3 conditions:

>> See zero commission plan
It is difficult for many savers to have the investment products that Unicaja requires to be exempt from commissions.
The most sensible decision will be to leave, and there are alternatives:



Unicaja markets its Online Account paid with and without payroll, being a hybrid between the Online Account of Banco Sabadell and Bankinter.
It is an offer for new clients, like those of other banks, rewarding them via remuneration.
UnicajaBanco now offers in its ""Unpaid Online Account"", what a name by the way, a 2% APR for 1 year if you domiciliate your payroll, and if not, at 1% APR.
This profitability is offered to you for a maximum of €30,000. Look what a coincidence, the same as Banco Sabadell.
But we must also say that Unicaja, starting in the second year, does remunerate your money, at 0.5% APR, unlike Sabadell, which does not.
It is hard for us to believe that ING is not the bank with the most fans, but this is what a study carried out by EMO Insights shows.
The bank with the most fans is Banco Mediolanum with 54.4% of its clients who declare themselves admirers of the entity."

How to avoid them?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/no-puedo-cambiar-de-banco-y-me-cobra-comisiones-como-evitarlas/,09/03/2021,"With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions (see here), many people have had no choice but to pay.
Because? Well, they require certain relationships that they are not willing to assume, such as taking out insurance, a pension plan or an investment fund.
…And they cannot leave either, and it is not because there are no alternatives, but because they have some product contracted with the bank that is not easy to get rid of without cost, such as:
In any case, you have to evaluate the cost of the change: canceling the deposit, subrogating the mortgage, against the commissions that will be paid over the months.
There are 2 ways to act and depending on a date, April 29, 2012 and the issue is exclusivity.
You must leave the account for exclusive use of the link. If it is a mortgage, for example, an account only for the payment of installments with money deposited via transfer.
The bad thing is that if your mortgage requires or gives you a bonus, for example the direct debit of a payroll, you would fail to comply with the conditions or lose the bonuses.
1. Before April 29, 2012
The Bank of Spain says that: «The accounts are maintained by imposition of the entity and are used exclusively to pay the interest on a deposit, or to service a mortgage or personal loan, or payments derived from any other type of operation. , it is not up to clients to bear any maintenance and/or administration commission.""
2. After April 29, 2012
From that date onwards, you can be charged for an exclusive use account for the linked product.
But, the Bank of Spain indicates that the bank must have ""previously informed clients about the requirement - if applicable - to contract the linked account; of the total cost corresponding to the maintenance of said account; that both the contracting and its cost are expressly included in the contract, and that said cost cannot be unilaterally modified by the entity throughout the life of the loan, credit or deposit.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to charge you anything either.

But if you want, you take the payroll and they give you €150.
For it to be completely free, you do not need payroll, receipts, or anything at all.
They only ask that you be a new customer and a digital customer, giving up postal mail and the use of their offices (even using their electronic banking and/or ATMs) to:
In short, like any online bank like Openbank or Orange Bank; but you have the possibility of using their offices if necessary.
If you do, you will have to pay a commission that quarter: it is €30.
If you don't go to their offices, you will have everything for free:

Whether you are a new customer or not, if you bring a payroll or pension of more than €600 to the bank you will get a €150 bonus.
The ideal is to direct your payroll to the Online Account and enjoy everything for free.
When giving you the €150 (subject to withholding), the bank requires 24 months of permanence.
The bonus payment is made when the first payroll appears in your account.
This offer is valid until June 30, 2021.

ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?"
927,He tells us that in Castilla-La Mancha he has paid the thermal social bonus today,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/nos-dice-que-en-castilla-la-mancha-ha-pagado-hoy-el-bono-social-termico/,05/03/2021,"According to a user of our website, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha (JCCM) has paid today, March 5, the 2020 thermal social bonus to the beneficiaries of this Autonomous Community.
We have tried to contact the Board, but we have achieved absolutely nothing.
If you were waiting for payment of this aid, check your bank accounts, and tell us (below in the comments).
It would be the first Autonomous Community to make the payment of this aid corresponding to the 2020 thermal social bonus, and it arrives at least 1 year late than what the law establishes.
JCCM sent notifications to beneficiaries since October 1 with the amount of aid for each beneficiary (see details here).
This aid, in the first year (winter 2018/2019), was managed by the central government and the payment was not made until the end of 2019.
But in 2020 (winter 2019/2020) it is managed by the different Autonomous Communities and they have surpassed the central government in incompetence.
The beneficiaries who now receive the aid are those who had been granted the electric social bonus as of December 31, 2019.
The 2021 aid (winter 2020/2021) by law would have to be paid to you before the end of this month of March 2021. But since you are paying the 2019/2020 aid, well, who knows.
The aid depends on the General State Budget, and it is most likely that this year we will harvest without those budgets, so we think that the amount of aid this year will be the same as last year, which depends on its vulnerability and the climatic zone. :
Depending on the composition of the family unit and its income, it is classified as vulnerable and severely vulnerable. Being the second ones entitled to 60% more help.

Depending on the harshness of the climate where the family resides, they will receive more or less help.

Starting today, you can file your 2023 income tax return. Before doing anything, you must verify if you are obliged to do so. If not, you should also check if your return is returnable, if so, you should present it to recover what is yours.
We indicate the conditions.
Today the 2023 income campaign begins, and you can now access Renta Web to consult your draft income, verify and/or modify it, and if everything is correct, confirm it.
Don't be in a hurry either, you have until July 1 to complete this procedure.
The entry of CA Auto Bank deposits in Spain has suffered strong fluctuations in just a few months.
Its initial offer, starting in January 2024, was so good (4.12% APR), that it saturated its hiring process in a couple of weeks, and forced the entity to suspend new registration applications.
When they reactivated it, the supply fell drastically (3.45% APR), and the interest of savers too, and now it seems that the bank is trying to find the balance between supply and demand, slightly increasing the profitability of its products ( up to 3.55% APR)."

According to the French newspaper, ""Chained Duck"", Orange wants to get rid of its neobank and is looking for a buyer for the shares of the bank it owns.
According to this same newspaper, and reported by different websites, several French entities would be interested: BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, which already have a digital solution for their banking.
If it were finally acquired by one of these banks, it will not be known what the future of its clients will be: they will remain in Orange Bank or moved to its online subsidiaries.
There is some uncertainty. If it continued like this, it could be declared bankrupt and therefore, clients would have to go to the FGD (French) to recover their money. Remember, €100,000 per person.
The good thing is that there are other banks interested in acquiring it, and if it ends up being like this, it will mean nothing to their clients.
Of course, once the new owner comes in, he will make changes, and by then it could be decided. It would also get rid of Orange's ""bad reputation.""

929,CaixaBank and Bankia merger: perhaps the FGD does not cover everything and other consequences,https://www.tucapital.es/bancos/fgd-fondo-de-garantia-de-depositos/fusion-caixabank-y-bankia-quizas-el-fgd-no-te-cubra-todo-y-otras-consecuencias/,03/03/2021,"This month the merger between CaixaBank and Bankia is planned, and the clients of both entities will become a single bank.
We remind you that the FGD covers €100,000 per person and entity. Until now, you could have €100,000 in Bankia and another €100,000 in CaixaBank; in total €200,000 under the umbrella of the FGD.
With the merger, by becoming a single bank, it will only cover €100,000 per person, and anything above that amount would be outside the FGD. In the example case, half of your money.
The entity resulting from the merger will have 20 million clients with more than 330,000 million euros in deposits, which represents almost a quarter of all deposits.
The consequences will be more or less the same:
Both Bankia (€168) and CaixaBank (€240) charge commissions for their accounts if you DO NOT join.
We believe that if you are in one of these entities it is because you have links and they do not charge you commissions.
But be careful, that banks can change the conditions of the accounts and their links and of course the cards. They simply have to notify you 1 or 2 months in advance.
If you want to get rid of commissions, you can in both entities and without having to link.
These are your online accounts (On Account from Bankia and ImaginBank from CaixaBank) without commissions, so we imagine that the result of the 2 banks is to keep an account of this style.
Of course, forget about going to their offices to do anything. Only online and ATMs.
Conditions and bindings cannot be changed.
The bad thing is the associated account from which the mortgage is paid, it will possibly have commissions, and it will depend on the commercial policy of the resulting bank.
The good thing about the current situation is that if you are not convinced, there are other banks that have open arms to subrogate your mortgage, of course, you will have to have a very solvent profile.
CaixaBank will carry out the technological integration with Bankia between Friday, November 12, and Sunday, November 14, 2021.
There will also be more commissions for Bankia customers: for the card and for the On Account
As we said a few days ago, Caixa Bank will eliminate the Bankia On Account and all its conditions and they will be transferred to the Day to Day Account with payment of up to €240 commission if you do not join (see here).
But that's not all, the debit card will also have commissions even if you comply with the Day by Day Account links. You will have to cancel it or you will pay €36 commission per year.
CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022."
930,Electricity will be more expensive with the new 2.0TD rate for everyone with PVPC and starting June 1,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/luz-sera-mas-cara-con-la-nueva-tarifa-2-0td-para-todos-con-pvpc-y-a-partir-de-1-de-junio/,02/03/2021,"It seemed strange to us that politicians were going to legislate for the benefit of consumers and taxpayers or the majority of them.
It would have been like this, if it had maintained the current prices and imposed time discrimination for everyone with the new 2.0TD electricity rate as we said in a previous article (see here).
With the new 2.0TD electricity rate, many people (those who are not there) will be forced to take advantage of the time discrimination (which is cheaper), but this will not be the case, because prices rise.
These (without time discrimination) will pay more or less the same, and those who currently have time discrimination will pay close to €100 more:
This increase for those who have time discrimination is precisely what they currently save compared to those who do not have discrimination.
That is to say, we will all pay more or less what those who do not have time discrimination pay right now.
These calculations are Ingebau estimates using prices published by the government and their entry into force, now scheduled for June 1, 2021, has been delayed.
Here we have the result: pic.twitter.com/d3L5QgwEaq
— ingebau (@ingebau) February 26, 2021

The changes do not affect you if you do not have the PVPC (voluntary small consumer price, formerly TUR), the regulated tariff (now it will have a new regulation) and the cheapest one.
If you do not have this rate, you should worry, you are most likely paying more every year, see here.
The new 2.0TD electricity rate is a rate with time discrimination of 3 sections during working days (Monday to Friday):

The 24 hours on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays are considered off-peak hours.
It looks quite similar to the current 3-section one. There will be 2 hours less peak than the current system during weekdays, and we will have cheap electricity all weekends.
The schedules also change, starting the peak hour earlier (10:00) but we will have electricity at an average price from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
With the new pricing, the ideal would be to concentrate all consumption between 00:00 and 8:00 on weekdays and weekends: put the accumulators, water heaters, dishwashers, washing machines at that time.
You can also choose 2 different powers:
Here one considers lowering the power during off-peak hours (from 0:00 to 8:00). But be careful, it affects the power of the entire day on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays.
You must verify what power you need at all times, and what you are willing to do.
If you are used to turning everything on at any time, leave your power as it is (unless you have a stupid one).
But if you don't mind, you could carry out a study and adapt the power to your needs to pay a little less.
We are going to change little. We will continue with the power as it is, currently 3.45 KW at all times. It perfectly supports the oven and 2 or 3 induction hobs and the lights at the same time (nothing more).
We will try to run the washing machines on the weekends and the dishwasher at night.
We have already programmed the electric water heater to accumulate hot water (75º-80º, 100 liters) during off-peak hours, which will allow us to shower when we get up and/or when we return from work at night.
We will cook like now, when it's time, regardless of schedules.
The new 2.0TD electricity rate will come into effect next Tuesday, June 1, which will be more expensive and will have time discrimination.
The PVPC is the cheapest rate in most cases (up to €200 cheaper per year), with the change it will continue to be so, but you will have to pay something more.
In the month of April 2021, the new electricity rate (2.0 TD) will come into effect, which will have time discrimination for everyone and will benefit many people.
We tell you why, and what the new 2021 electricity rate will be like.
During the month of January, it appeared in all written and electronic media that the price of electricity was at historic highs, creating almost alarm among consumers.
But that didn't affect everyone and now the price is at its lowest either. Only to those from the PVPC.
Both then and now, almost all of those in the PVPC (half of the households) pay less than those in the free market. And we can prove it to you."
931,"Pibank and Pichincha maintain your deposit at 0.8% APR until March 31, 2021",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/pibank-y-pichincha-mantiene-su-deposito-al-08-tae-hasta-el-31-de-marzo-2021/,02/03/2021,"Pibank, the online office of Banco Pichincha, and Banco Pichincha have extended the contracting period for their deposit to 12 months and at 0.8% APR until March 31, 2021.
In 2021, Banco Pichincha has been setting the same term as its Online office, unlike previous years which gave a much longer term.
The characteristics of the 12-month deposit:
A few months ago a website user and Pichincha customer sent us a message indicating that the commissions for early cancellation are different from those advertised on the website.
On the Pibank and Pichincia website it indicates that ""as a penalty for partial or total early cancellation, all interest received will be deducted.""
However, this client does not send a screenshot when he goes to contract the deposit that the cancellation fees are 0.9%.

If you are still a client of Banco Pichincha and not Pibank, we recommend that you switch to the latter. You have the same advantages, but with the Savings Account renting at 0.5% APR instead of 0.3% APR.
But you can easily make the change with a simple call to Pibank and it will transfer you to the online office and greater profitability.
We remind you that Pibank is simply an online office of Banco Pichincha, to all employees it is still Banco Pichincha.
These are the conditions of your paid account:


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
932,Wizink continues to give 0.8% APR on its Deposits in March. No changes since August,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/wizink-sigue-en-marzo-dando-al-08-tae-en-su-depositos-sin-cambios-desde-agosto/,01/03/2021,"Wizink maintains its deposits unchanged in March 2021, offering a maximum profitability of 0.8% APR.
This interest rate was set in the month of August with a substantial drop:
In the month of August, the entity also cut the profitability of its savings account from 0.5% APR to 0.1% APR.
The good thing is that accounts opened before August 1st continue at 0.5% APR but only until April 30th. Starting May 1, it will be remunerated at 0.2% APR (see here).
Wizink Deposits

The characteristics of its deposits are:
The current features of this account are:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"

This is far from some banks that, even by direct debiting your payroll to the entity, still want to charge you commissions (see here).
This offer was valid until February 28, 2021, but the bank has extended it until June 30, 2021.
Demands:
As for the friend, it doesn't have to be a real friend of yours (if so, better), on the internet there are many people who offer to be your friend and you both win €25.
If you want, we could help you find a sponsor. We have codes, but if you want you can also organize among yourselves (leave comments below to be a godfather and/or godson).
The client's conditions are:
The conditions of the new client are:
Additionally, Guests who have canceled a Savings Account in the 12 months prior to the start of the promotion will not be able to participate in the promotion.
The Client will receive the €25 bonus at the end of the month in which the guest opens and activates the Online Savings Account.
The new client will receive their €25 at the end of the third month after having activated and deposited the minimum amount of €1,000.
More information here.
The catch is that it is a foreign bank, because for all intents and purposes NN Bank is a Dutch entity:
That is its weak point because it generates extra tasks for savers. However, you will not have extra tasks (except including interest in your income tax return) if you do not have more than €50,000 abroad.


NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
NN Bank or NN España will close the Savings Account of all its clients on November 20. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.
We commented a few months ago that NN Bank seemed to have lost its way, because it was one of the most profitable in recent years, but it did not react with the rate increases, and now, it no longer allows you to contract your account."

Furthermore, both in February and until April, the offer is not limited to the number of clients as it was before.
On the other hand, indicate that the €480 is tax-free, but you do not pay it all at once, but monthly, €20 clean per month for 2 years.
The bank is responsible for the corresponding income tax withholdings, so the client receives a total of €480 net.
The requirements are:
If in a month you do not meet the conditions, they will not pay you the €20 (payroll or cards). If you fail to comply for 3 consecutive months, you lose the right to receive it for the following months even if you meet the requirements.

The account characteristics are:
If you do not receive payroll direct debit for 3 consecutive months, you will no longer enjoy the cash withdrawal bonus at national and international ATMs.


Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.

That will have tax implications. The entity will begin to apply personal income tax withholdings directly to its clients and will notify the Tax Agency.
It will be the same as ING or Orange Bank. The foreign FGD will cover you (in this case Portugal), but your relationship with the bank will be with the Spanish branch and you will have a Spanish IBAN.
Many were reluctant to put the money in Raisin, because in the end your savings were sent to a foreign bank with language and, above all, tax problems:
With Haitong Bank, there will now be no such inconveniences, making the welcome Raisin offers more attractive.
They offer quite good returns for what there is now in Spain:
The downside is that these products are not cancelable or may imply relevant losses as indicated by the bank.
Payment of interest is due.
If you are a new Raisin customer, you can benefit from its customer acquisition campaign in which it offers up to €200 depending on the amount of the investment.
The double bonus is currently not in effect, but will return:
The minimum investment period for all products is 6 months and the bonus will be deposited:
The Spanish branch of Haitong Bank S.A. is part of Haitong Securities, one of the leading investment banks with securities businesses in China. The European headquarters is located in Lisbon, Portugal.
The bank is mainly active in Europe, America and Asia, with a special focus on the markets of Spain, Portugal, Poland, the United Kingdom, Brazil, the USA and India. Haitong Bank serves private and institutional clients and has a wide and versatile range of products. In 2016 Haitong Bank won different awards in categories such as “Euromoney Real Estate Awards”.
In June 2016, the bank announced that it had a core capital ratio of 10.7%, a number that exceeds the legally required level. Deposits contracted with Haitong Bank are guaranteed by the Portuguese Deposit Guarantee Fund.


Haitong Bank has slightly lowered the profitability of its deposits for 6 and 9 months, but maintains the maximum profitability of 3.55% APR that it offers in a fixed term of 1 year.
Specifically, the decrease is 0.1 percentage points, from 3.5% APR to 3.4% APR. The rest of the products have not changed.
Haitong Bank lowers the profitability of its deposits one more step, now offering a maximum of 3.55% APR over a 1-year term.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, then up to 3.75% APR and now up to 3.55% APR.
Haitong Bank takes another snip at its deposits, once again cutting the profitability of all its products.
In January it lost the 4% APR level, remaining at 3.95% APR, with this drop, the maximum profitability remains at 3.75% APR and is for a 1-year term.
At 2 years, the bank offers 3.63% APR, the second most profitable of the bank, and which, in our opinion, are the most interesting."

Openbank does charge €60 commission for 1 year now, but only to LEGAL PERSONS, that is, companies, associations, communities of owners...
Private clients will continue without commissions, at least for now.
In this sense, last January, the entity made a statement to its clients:
Hello xxxx:
We inform you that at Openbank all your checking and savings accounts remain commission-free.
We want you to enjoy your accounts without asking for anything in return. Therefore, remember that in your Open Checking Account and in the Openbank Savings Account it is not necessary to have payroll direct debit or a minimum balance.
Everything you expect from a digital bank! €0 in commissions on your accounts and many advantages.
It talks about Banco Santander and the commissions on its accounts, for INDIVIDUALS and only mentions in passing Openbank and its commissions of €60, without clarifying that it is for NON-INDIVIDUALS.
He also talks about several Banco Santander accounts, and as far as we know, they have all been unified into the Santander One Account with commissions of up to €240 per year (see here)
Openbank offers EVERYTHING for free and asks for nothing in return. Santander asks and asks and asks and doesn't stop asking to continue without commissions (see here)
In addition, Openbank often tries to attract new customers with offers:
>>See more details, here.
To its existing clients, it offers the advantage of a 1% refund of the amount of direct debit receipts, or specific offers and raffles for card use.
Openbank will apply a snip to your Savings Account in a percentage sense, because it will drop from the current 0.2% APR to 0.05% APR (a quarter) as of April 19 for clients with payroll domiciled in the entity.
It will also be a blow for clients without payroll in the entity. They will charge only 0.01% APR (from the current 0.05% APR).
The entity justifies the decrease due to low interest rates (like everyone else).
Curiously, it will be the same interest rate (0.01% APR) that ING offers (see here) from April 1, 2021, however, in order for ING to give you that profitability you have to have the payroll account open and complying. its conditions, otherwise 0.00% APR.
We believe that the people who are in Openbank (just like in ING) are not because of the profitability of their account, which before was already a pittance, and now it will be rubbish.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, for a 12-month term and at 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally

937,"ING friend plan only until this Sunday, €50 for each one",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/plan-amigo-ing-solo-hasta-este-domingo-50e-para-cada-uno/,25/02/2021,"The ING friend plan will end next Sunday, February 28, in which it offers €50 to an ING client (sponsor) with a payroll account, who brings a friend (godson) to the entity and direct debits a payroll, taking the friend also €50.
ING spends €100 for each payroll it captures in which it provides all free services, which contrasts quite a bit with other banks, which even with direct debit payroll continue to charge you commissions (see here).
It also exempts you from paying commissions on the Orange Account even if you have more than €30,000 and remunerates that account at 0.01% APR.
To qualify for this promotion, the godson must meet the following 2 points:
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 500 euros.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
>> More information.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."

There are a lot of complaints from people who try to register and cannot and when they try to contact the bank, they do not provide solutions.
And if you manage to advance in the process, many are asked for the income tax return, legal, but a little excessive for opening a simple savings account (see here).
Now we are receiving complaints from our users and bank clients that the entity has been out of service for several days.
An online entity that cannot access its electronic banking is as if a physical bank closed all its offices!
We contacted the bank yesterday, and they responded today, and that they are still ""working on getting everything working correctly and it will be available very soon.""

Well, nothing, you have to suck it up and keep waiting, without a deadline or anything at all.
It will offer 2 products:
This entity is not new to us. Until now we have known it as RCI Banque, a French entity whose deposits could be contracted in Spain.
With this launch, the bank was supposed to facilitate the contracting of its products: a website in Spanish and specific products for our country, but things are becoming more complicated.
Another point in favor is that opening a branch in Spain saves us from having to deal with the Treasury. This bank will apply personal income tax withholdings, it will operate like ING in Spain, only the FGD is French.
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.


As you have read, Orange Bank, a branch in Spain, offers deposits of more than 3% APR through the Raisin platform, Dutch version, and for clients in the Netherlands.
We were shocked when one of our users sent it to us via email.
Openbank continues to invent nonsense, like the previous milonga of €60 per balance increase, which we criticized at the beginning of the month of December.
This time, the entity offers a deposit with a fairly normal profitability (0.75% APR), but as if to make it excellent or attract attention, it gives you €20 in an Amazon check, if the deposit is €10,000 or more.
Renault Bank is once again late paying the interest on its account and/or deposits from the settlement for the month of June. Something similar already happened in December.
In this sense, some users have contacted us asking about the problem."

In which banks?",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/transferencias-en-el-dia-un-balsamico-de-las-inmediatas-que-es-en-que-bancos/,24/02/2021,"It is said that ""in the absence of bread, cakes are good."" Well, there are banks that do not offer immediate transfers, but in exchange, they offer their clients same-day transfers.
This type of transfer, if you issue it before a certain time, the money will arrive at its destination on the same day.
ING was a pioneer in launching this service (like many other things), and it has since been adopted by other entities.
For same-day transfers to work, you have to do it before a certain time.
The banks that have this service and their cut-off times are:
Evo Banco has immediate and free transfers, but this service has been suspended for more than 1 year due to technical adjustments. Meanwhile, same-day transfer service is available.
Orange Bank currently offers immediate transfers. But if the destination does not accept this type of transfers (non-affiliated entity), Orange Bank will automatically make a transfer on the day, if you do it before 1:00 p.m.
It will be a normal transfer, and the money will arrive the next day at those entities.
For banks that do not have same-day transfers, the money could take 2 days depending on when you request the transfer and its cut-off time.
>> See more details of the cut-off time.
The most expensive without a doubt and by far is Bankinter.
If you have 2 mobile numbers, you can transfer between your 2 bank accounts immediately using Bizum.
Logically, it has limitations that have been set by each bank and by Bizum, but you can move money instantly between your accounts.
>> See more detail here


Openbank does have the immediate transfer service, the bad thing is that the bank charges you a €4 commission (€2 if it is from the payroll account). However, you can use Bizum and it will be free.
We tell you how to do it.
If your bank does not offer you immediate transfers or charges you for them, you can use Bizum to do so.
We tell you how to do it and its limitations.
A couple of weeks ago we told you that both Unicaja and Orange Bank had lowered the limit of operations per month that will allow their Bizum clients from 150 to 60.
Today we confirm that it is Bizum that will lower this limit and will affect all banks."
940,Last days to get €480 in exchange for payroll at Deutsche Bank,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ultimos-dias-para-conseguir-480e-a-cambio-de-nomina-en-deutsche-bank/,24/02/2021,"The Deutsche Bank promotion in which they give away €480 in exchange for a salary will end this Sunday, February 28.
In principle, this offer was going to be until January 31, 2021, but the bank extended it until February 28. We don't know if the promotion will be extended, so if you are interested, hurry up.
In addition, during the month of February there is no limitation on the number of clients as there was before, so you will not have to worry about this point.
On the other hand, indicate that the €480 is not paid by the entity at once, but monthly, €20 per month for 2 years.
The requirements are:
If in a certain month you do not meet the conditions (income or use of the cards), that month the bank does not pay the €20 and the client also loses the right to receive it in the following months even if they meet the requirements.
The €20 per month are net. The bank is responsible for the corresponding income tax withholdings, so the client receives a total of €480 net.

The account characteristics are:
If you do not receive payroll direct debit for 3 consecutive months, you will no longer enjoy the cash withdrawal bonus at national and international ATMs.


Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.

941,New electricity rate 2021 with mandatory time discrimination will benefit many people,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/nueva-tarifa-luz-2021-con-discriminacion-horaria-obligatoria-beneficiara-a-mucha-gente/,23/02/2021,"In the month of April 2021, the new electricity rate (2.0 TD) will come into effect, which will have time discrimination for everyone and will benefit many people.
The changes do not affect you if you do not have the PVPC (voluntary small consumer price, formerly TUR), the regulated rate and the cheapest. If you do not have this rate, you should worry, because you are paying about €200 a year more, see here.
Those who do have the PVPC would save money if they took advantage of the time discrimination and without having to change their consumption habits.
Most people object to the issue of time discrimination, but you can forget about that. Use the light as always and it will be cheaper.
According to various media, between 85% and 90% of households would pay less (with their current consumption) with time discrimination, but only 5% of households are with this modality.
With the entry into force of the new electricity rate in 2021, the majority of households will benefit, since time discrimination will be mandatory for everyone.
As we say, there is no need to change your consumption habit. It is cheaper because:
Furthermore, if you are worried about your bill, with time discrimination, if you make an efficient consumption habit, you will pay even less.
It is estimated that having between 30% or 40% of consumption in the low-cost segment makes time discrimination appropriate.
In fact, if you have the PVPC you can check if you would have paid more or less. At the end of your bill you will see the cost of your consumption in the 3 modalities: normal, and with 2 or 3 time discrimination sections (tell us your case in the comments below).
Time discrimination will not be as we know it now. It will be for everyone in 3 sections on weekdays (Monday to Friday):
The 24 hours on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays are considered off-peak hours.
It looks quite similar to the current 3-section one. There will be 2 hours less peak than the current system during weekdays, and we will have cheap electricity all weekends.
The schedules also change, starting the peak hour earlier (10:00) but we will have electricity at an average price from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
With the new pricing, the ideal would be to concentrate all consumption between 00:00 and 8:00 on weekdays and weekends: put the accumulators, water heaters, dishwashers, washing machines at that time.
You can also choose 2 different powers:
Here one considers lowering the power during off-peak hours (from 0:00 to 8:00). But be careful, it affects the power of the entire day on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays.
You must verify what power you need at all times, and what you are willing to do.
If you are used to turning everything on at any time, leave your power as it is (unless you have a stupid one).
But if you don't mind, you could carry out a study and adapt the power to your needs to pay a little less.
We are going to change little. We will continue with the power as it is, currently 3.45 KW at all times. It perfectly supports the oven and 2 or 3 induction hobs and the lights at the same time (nothing more).
We will try to run the washing machines on the weekends and the dishwasher at night.
We have already programmed the electric water heater to accumulate hot water (75º-80º, 100 liters) during off-peak hours, which will allow us to shower when we get up and/or when we return from work at night.
We will cook like now, when it's time, regardless of schedules.
The new 2.0TD electricity rate will come into effect next Tuesday, June 1, which will be more expensive and will have time discrimination.
The PVPC is the cheapest rate in most cases (up to €200 cheaper per year), with the change it will continue to be so, but you will have to pay something more.
It seemed strange to us that politicians were going to legislate for the benefit of consumers and taxpayers or the majority of them.
It would have been like this if they had maintained the prices and forced everyone to use the time-sensitive rate.
What it is really going to do is equalize everyone, making those who currently pay less pay more, the time discrimination thing.
During the month of January, it appeared in all written and electronic media that the price of electricity was at historic highs, creating almost alarm among consumers.
But that didn't affect everyone and now the price is at its lowest either. Only to those from the PVPC.
Both then and now, almost all of those in the PVPC (half of the households) pay less than those in the free market. And we can prove it to you."
942,Are the new debit cards without data more secure? from which banks?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/las-nuevas-tarjetas-de-debito-sin-datos-son-mas-seguros-de-que-bancos/,23/02/2021,"Even with PSD2 double security verification, if your bank card is lost or stolen, money can be taken from your bank account.
Right now, with the data that appears on your card: number, expiration date and CVV, they can make online purchases, within limits, without your consent.
To avoid this problem, some banks, but not most, no longer print this information on your card and if you want to see it, you have to check it in their electronic banking (website or APP).
1. Orange Bank
He was a pioneer, giving you a card exclusively with your name, without more.
If you want to see the rest of the data, via the bank's APP, always with prior identification. PIN, Fingerprint or similar.
2. BBVA Aqua Card
There is no data on the card, it can only be consulted in the bank's APP.
The CVV is generated dynamically from the APP, and expires after 5 minutes.
3. Virtual cards
You will not directly have a physical card. You can check your data via APP or electronic banking.
You can associate it with your mobile phone (mobile payment) and make payments in stores and withdraw cash at contactless ATMs.
Openbank offers one of these cards for free, the Virtual Debit Card.
By not showing data on the card you prevent them from making online purchases for you; but they can still withdraw money from your account by making payments in contactless businesses within certain limits.
In online purchases with card details, nothing is required for payments of less than €30. Of course, it is allowed 5 times a day or €100 in 24 hours.
In the case of payments in physical stores with contactless, the current limit due to COVID is €50 without PIN, but the norm is €20.
It is also required to enter the PIN when 150 euros or 5 consecutive operations without PIN are accumulated.
Currently, banks allow certain configurations on cards to increase security:
And most importantly activate card payment notifications. Normally the bank sends you an SMS or communicates via APP every time your card is used.
As we have said, with the physical card you can easily get €150 or even more if your card details are stolen.
But consumers are not ""sold."" They can recover their money or at least part of it in 2 ways:
Banks take part of the blame for card fraud. 2 situations are considered:
1. Fraud with card still in your possession
If money is stolen from you in any way, you still have the card. The bank is responsible for the entire amount defrauded.
2. Fraud with loss of card
In this case, the bank makes you responsible for part of what was defrauded. As a kind of co-payment, and its amount is €50.
Therefore, if you lose your card, you can easily have up to €150 stolen. You lose €50 and the bank assumes the rest (€100).
The trader
If you have not received a refund of the entire amount defrauded, you can contact the seller.
Normally they will return your money, because they do not want to tarnish their image with these fraudulent operations; especially if they are large chains.
In fact, they have accepted contactless payments without PIN because it speeds up cash operations at the risk of greater fraud (which they assume).
PSD2 is now in force for card payments both in e-commerce and in physical stores.
Of course, it will not be immediately in all stores, but little by little. In any case, get used to carrying your cell phone with you or you won't be able to pay with your card.
As for fraud, who pays the price? You, the bank or the merchant?
Not long ago, to pay by card, they asked for your ID and verified your signature. Then the PIN arrived and they stopped ordering. Now, with Contactless, not even that.
But are we still safe? Could they rob us? Can we get the money back? We answer you.
One of the most demanded products in any banking entity are credit cards. There are many different options available to users and we can even find a ranking of the best debit and credit cards. In addition to financing, there are many more services that offer this type of card, but which one is the best for you? It is difficult to choose the one that best suits your needs, but not impossible. You just have to follow a series of key tips to make the right choice."

The start date of the promotion is tomorrow, February 23, 2021, and will last until the end of the year.
On the BBVA website it appears that this promotion, ""Invite a friend"" is not active, but we also know that BBVA is not one of the fastest in updating its website; Let's wait until tomorrow.
If you are a customer of the bank and want to check if you can be a sponsor of this promotion, you just have to enter your electronic banking, both website and mobile APP, where an ""invite a friend"" section should appear.
In this section you can see your promotion code to be a godfather, which you must share with your friends and family so that they can use it during the process of registering the BBVA Online account, along with the Aqua card.
The godson will also have to use the Aqua card to pay for a purchase for an amount equal to or greater than 15 euros within a maximum period of 3 months from registration.
Payment of bonuses will be made once compliance with the previous points is verified.
BBVA allows you to sponsor a maximum of 10 new clients, so you can earn a total of €50.
NOTE: if you want to be a godfather or godson, leave a comment below.
BBVA is one of the banks that imposes a lot of commissions on its clients or many links (see here)
But there is an exception in this entity, and it is the online account that does not charge commissions or require conditions:
The bad thing is that it indicates that it is exclusively for new customers: ""If you are not yet a BBVA customer, this online account is for you"" as indicated on its website.
But according to customer experience, it can be contracted, but with some disadvantages (debit card with cost?).


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."

Specifically, it concerns non-compliance with regard to the delivery of pre-contractual information (especially in cases of novations), as well as its content (omission of formalization expenses and other mandatory costs) and the contractual documentation. (omission of the APR), as well as with regard to the calculation of the APR.
In short, it fails to comply with Order 2899/2011 and Circular 5/2012 of the Bank of Spain. They are regulations from 2012 and fines are being imposed years later.
In this case, Ibercaja's fine was published last December 2020 for events between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017.
The fine imposed was 1,080,000 euros.
Curiously, ING, the bank that we all assume to be the most transparent bank, has been the bank with the highest fine. He committed 2 errors, 3 million for deficiency in the APR calculation and 2.4 million for not controlling the agencies that gave these offers with misinformation.
If we add the sanctions from Popular to those from Banco Santander (5.7 million), to which it belonged already in 2018 and in fact imposed on Santander, it would be the ""winning"" bank.
We thought we would keep it separate, because the infraction was committed in Popular, even though Santander had to assume it.
Another similar and related infraction that banks have committed and that have been sanctioned appears to be non-compliance with Laws 41/2007, 2/1994 and 44/2002.
It's related to:
The banks fined are:
A curious fact is that Bankia and Sabadell do not appear; although they have already committed enough misdeeds with the issue of floor clauses.
Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."

The most significant recent example has been Banco Santander, from its Account 123 that paid 3% APR, returned 3% of your receipts and endless benefits, now charging you up to €240 per year in commission if you do not hyper-links in Santander One.
All this has happened within a period of 5 years, where the interest rate has not changed much. The Euribor has dropped just over half a point, going from 0.1% to -0.5%.
The most sensible thing, especially if you do not meet the conditions, is to leave the bank to avoid paying commissions; there are always alternatives.
But there are people who are tied in one way or another to the bank because they have other products in the entity:
These ties can be released: a mortgage can be subrogated, a deposit can be cancelled, etc.
But not everyone is willing to make these moves, especially because of the cost involved.
Here there are 2 ways to act and depending on a date, April 29, 2012 and the issue is exclusivity.
You must leave the account for exclusive use of the link. If it is a mortgage, for example, an account only for the payment of installments with money deposited via transfer.
The bad thing is that if your mortgage requires or gives you a bonus, for example the direct debit of a payroll, you would fail to comply with the conditions or lose the bonuses.
1. Before April 29, 2012
The Bank of Spain says that: «The accounts are maintained by imposition of the entity and are used exclusively to pay the interest on a deposit, or to service a mortgage or personal loan, or payments derived from any other type of operation. , it is not up to clients to bear any maintenance and/or administration commission.""
2. After April 29, 2012
From that date onwards, you can be charged for an exclusive use account for the linked product.
But, the Bank of Spain indicates that the bank must have ""previously informed clients about the requirement - if applicable - to contract the linked account; of the total cost corresponding to the maintenance of said account; that both the contracting and its cost are expressly included in the contract, and that said cost cannot be unilaterally modified by the entity throughout the life of the loan, credit or deposit.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to charge you anything either.
>> See more details on page 355 of the BdE 2019 complaints report


Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are, but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost.
But we tell you how to stay in the bank.
As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.
We tell you a way to get rid of commissions in these cases."

This is the payroll collection promotion that the bank offers as a bonus to clients who deposit their payroll and maintain it for 12 months, with a monthly payment of €20 per month.
As an additional condition, the bank requested that there be a payroll note every month. In case of failure of any month, the client was left without the €20 for that month, and if 3 consecutive months were missed, they would lose the rest of the bonuses.
Well, the month of January ended on a Sunday, and some clients' paychecks did not arrive until February 1, and for that reason they have not received the €20.

We have contacted them again to see what they say about it, and if they are going to pay everyone without them having to complain.
And we have received a response, below.
The first messages from the bank were: ""if no payroll was paid into the account in the month of January, that month has not generated the right to the 20 euro bonus.""
We contacted the bank and there was no response other than ""we'll look at it.""
Today, February 19, the bank has informed us that it will pay, we believe that to all:

Deutsche Bank has improved its offer to capture a payroll, now giving €360 in cash, as before, and at 2.5% APR for an amount from €10,000 to €100,000.
Profitability has increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2% APR to 2.5% APR during the first year.
As for the paid balance, it is now more flexible, from €10,000 instead of €50,000. Of course, the upper limit has dropped from €500,000 to €100,000.
Deutsche Bank has 2 mutually compatible offers in which it gives new clients a 2% APR return on their money during the first year, and €360 net in cash if you domiciliate a payroll, pension or unemployment benefit.
Today we echo an email received that denounced ""what is hidden in the conditions of the current promotion of the Deutsche Bank More DB Account."""
947,Bank with Bizum? Use Bizum for instant transfer between my accounts?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/que-bancos-ofrecen-bizum-puedo-utilizar-bizum-para-transferir-dinero-entre-mis-cuentas/,18/02/2021,"Yesterday, when making the comparison table of banks without commissions and without conditions (see here) we realized that not all of them offered Bizum, the system to instantly send money from mobile to mobile and for payment in stores.
This service is having spectacular growth. In 2020, the number of users doubled, reaching more than 12 million, reaching 70% of digital banking clients in Spain.
Banks that do not have this service will be a problem in attracting new customers or maintaining those they already have.
Its evolution is such that even ING, which had a similar system (Twyp), had to join this platform due to the overwhelming request of its clients, of course, only if you have a payroll account.
Orange Bank, a very newly created bank, was one of the first things it added to its basic services since its launch.
Currently the banks that offer this service are those in the following list in alphabetical order. If your bank is not there, you will not be able to do a Bizum (or send or receive money).
Bizum is a service to send and receive money instantly and without needing to know the Current Account, just the recipient's phone number.
In this way, it is a faster, more agile and friendly service than a bank transfer.
It also allows you to make online payments, and also payments in physical stores (members).
Furthermore, at the moment no bank affiliated with Bizum is going to charge for this service, although you never know in the future. Each bank can set rates and commissions just like any other banking service.
Yes, you can transfer money between your accounts instantly using Bizum.
The buts, that you need 2 mobile lines and for movements of a small amount of money (within the limits of Bizum).
Keep in mind that Bizum associates an account with a mobile number. Once configured (from the bank's APP), you can send money from one of your accounts (Mobile No. 1) to another of your accounts (Mobile No. 2).
In addition, the change (associating number to account) is done instantly, you can configure it according to your needs at all times.
Bizum's general limits are:
Openbank does have the immediate transfer service, the bad thing is that the bank charges you a €4 commission (€2 if it is from the payroll account). However, you can use Bizum and it will be free.
We tell you how to do it.
If your bank does not offer you immediate transfers or charges you for them, you can use Bizum to do so.
We tell you how to do it and its limitations.
A couple of weeks ago we told you that both Unicaja and Orange Bank had lowered the limit of operations per month that will allow their Bizum clients from 150 to 60.
Today we confirm that it is Bizum that will lower this limit and will affect all banks."
948,"EBN reduces its Savings Account by half: new ones now at 0.15% APR, and old ones in May",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ebn-baja-hasta-la-mitad-su-cuenta-ahorro-nuevos-desde-ya-al-015-tae-y-antiguos-en-mayo/,18/02/2021,"EBN Banco has reduced its profitability by half: from 0.3% APR to 0.15% APR of its savings account.
This new interest rate applies now to new customers and to old customers starting next May 1.
The previous rate cut for this account was made on July 1, 2019. Previously, it was remunerated at 0.5% APR.
Thus, the account has the following characteristics:
Its contract is automatic if you make a deposit in the bank, or you can exclusively contract the account here.
With this reduction, the entity joins the ranks of the most profitable accounts on the market, only surpassing Wizink.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients at 0.5% APR and starting in May at 0.2% APR
*EBN maintains 0.3% APR for former clients, and as of May 1, it will drop to 0.15% APR
Currently its only available deposits are for renewals of its clients' deposits.
It is the SinyCon Plus deposit whose interest rate was cut by the bank last week:
The rest of the features are:


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."
949,Wizink will reduce the savings accounts of former clients from 0.5% to 0.2% APR,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/wizink-rebaja-desde-el-05-hasta-el-02-tae-las-cuentas-de-antiguos-clientes/,17/02/2021,"Wizink is informing its former clients who continue to enjoy the 0.5% APR on their accounts, that as of May 1, 2021, it will be reduced to 0.2% APR.
These clients are those who contracted a savings account at Wizink before August 1, 2020, and since then, new contracts are remunerated at 0.1% APR.
Therefore, these clients will continue to charge twice as much as new clients, although the cut represents a 60% drop in profitability.

In relation to the savings account(s) that you have contracted with WiZink, we want to inform you that, as of May 1, 2021, the interest rate on your WiZink savings account(s) will change from 0.50% APR to 0.20%1 APR.
Remember that your WiZink savings account/s have no commissions and are remunerated from the first euro and with no limit on the maximum balance.
In addition, you will continue to have your money always available, so you continue saving in the simplest way.
If you have a deposit contracted with us, your conditions will not be modified.
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.
The characteristics of its deposits are:


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
950,"Comparative table of alternatives to banks with commissions: Santander, BBVA…",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/tabla-comparativa-de-las-alternativas-a-los-bancos-con-comisiones-santander-bbva-caixabank-bankia-sabadell/,17/02/2021,"Yesterday we published an article about alternatives to large banks that offer everything for nothing (see here).
In total, there were 11 banks in addition to another 3 that our users contributed.
The advantages of each bank were described there, which we collect in this article in a comparative table; much more intuitive and easier to see the good in each one.
NOTE: we have eliminated Pibank from the list, because if this bank does not direct deposit a payroll, it does not give you a card nor does it allow direct deposit of receipts. It would be a Remunerated account at 0.5% APR (very interesting), but it would only be a savings account and there would be many more, such as Renaultbank (0.65% APR).
If you read us from your mobile phone, put it in landscape mode to see the following table, it will look much better. Thank you.
Entities that allow cash withdrawals at all ATMs have limitations: number of times or require a minimum amount.
There are entities that only allow withdrawals at their own ATMs and others have agreements with a wide network of ATMs. Check our ATM traffic light (here).
We consider that it has offices, if it has enough. Not like ING or Evo Banco whose number is very small. Openbank only has one office of its own, but you have all the Santander offices to withdraw money for free.
Other entities that have offices, but require payment of commissions if you want to operate in them (cost).
We consider that it does have offices, although it requires certain conditions, such as Abanca, which allows you to withdraw cash for amounts that cannot be done at an ATM.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients and for an initial 12 months and is limited to €15,000.
*Orangebank limits its profitability to €20,000.


In 2 months, Banco Sabadell will give its Expansion Account clients a hard blow by requiring them to comply with the new conditions or they will have to pay commissions.
Our advice is to go to another bank. We leave you up to 12 alternatives without commissions and without conditions and with some additional advantages.
Activo Bank has gone for years without any major news, and now it is because it seems that it is reaching the end of its life.
The entity reports on its website that its Active Account ""cannot be contracted temporarily."" Searching more online, the entity plans to migrate these clients to Banco Sabadell, in a new online account, in the style of BBVA or Banco Santander.
Banks increasingly demand more and more from their clients if they do not want to pay commissions, but there are still entities and offers in which clients, without giving anything in return, continue without having to pay anything.
Whoever pays commissions in 2022 will be because they want to or because they are too lazy to change, because there are offers for all tastes:"
951,"Scissoring in Openbank, it will offer the same misery as ING but without requiring a payroll account",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/tijeretazo-en-openbank-ofrecera-la-misma-miseria-que-ing-pero-sin-exigir-cuenta-nomina/,16/02/2021,"Openbank will apply a snip to your Savings Account in a percentage sense, because it will drop from the current 0.2% APR to 0.05% APR (a quarter) as of April 19 for clients with payroll domiciled in the entity.
It will also be a blow for clients without payroll in the entity. They will charge only 0.01% APR (from the current 0.05% APR).
The entity justifies the decrease due to low interest rates (like everyone else).
Curiously, it will be the same interest rate (0.01% APR) that ING offers (see here) from April 1, 2021, however, in order for ING to give you that profitability you have to have the payroll account open and complying. its conditions, otherwise 0.00% APR.
We believe that the people who are in Openbank (just like in ING) are not because of the profitability of their account, which before was already a pittance, and now it will be rubbish.
We believe people use it for the following reasons:
Let's hope they don't go around with nonsense like ING that is going to start charging commissions to people who only have the Orange Account and with more than €30,000 (see here)

As always, at Openbank we try to offer simple products without hidden costs. We would love for you to continue using your Savings Account as before, but in case you decide to close it, you can do so free of charge by calling 91 177 33 10 before April 19, 2021. If you do not do so before this date, we will understand. that you accept the new conditions.
Thank you for your trust
The Welcome Savings Account will continue at 5% APR for the moment for a period of 6 months and a maximum of €5,000
The welcome bonus is €125 gross or just over €100 net, in exchange it requires:
The good thing about direct debiting your payroll in Openbank is that you recover 1% of the direct debit bills for electricity, gas, telephone, mobile phone and internet. Currently no one else offers anything like this.
For new clients of the entity who do not want to domiciliate the payroll, the bank offers a 1% APR for 6 months for a maximum of €5,000
The welcome bonus is €25 gross or just over €20 net.
In this case it does not require anything, just that you are a new customer and open the account with the promotional code WELCOME.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Openbank once again offers its Exclusive Deposit, in this case, for a 12-month term and at 3.15% APR to certain clients who are threatening to transfer their money to another entity.
The offer was lower during the month of March, at 2% APR, but now, it has once again offered those 3.15% APR; being an offer much higher than that offered generally
Today we echo an email received that reports ""non-payment of the promotion - Multi-Track Savings Time - for balance increases in both checking accounts and deposits.""
Our user has asked us to give him a voice and in case the information is ""of interest"", knowing that we have published ""news on other occasions following complaints from readers."""

The bank received more than €10,000,000,000 (10 billion) in commissions in 2020 and they want more (see here), but don't give up.
The easy solution and what really hurts the banks is that you go to another one and when you start losing thousands and thousands of customers, maybe they will think twice before doing something similar in the future.
Furthermore, there are very good alternatives on the market and on top of that now, the change is very simple if you use bank portability (see here): You go to the bank where you want to go, you tell them everything you want to contract and take and they take care of it. of everything.
A couple of months ago we already published the list of the most interesting banks without commissions and without conditions or links and in this article we want to expand the list with some more entities.
NOTE: If you want to join, there are banks that give you up to €480 (read here).
Without further ado, we leave you the list of all these banks. But if you want you can see here the comparative table of all these banks: their advantages and their services.
It offers everything for free in exchange for nothing (account, transfers, card, all ATMs 3 times a month), and is one of the few that offers free immediate transfers and also free Bizum.
In addition, it remunerates your money very well, at 1% APR for the first €20,000.
The buts:
Perhaps with these buts, many would remove it from this list and we would agree with them, but that 1% APR...
Give everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers, and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It does not have immediate transfers, but it does have transfers on the day (before 12:00)
In addition, your money is remunerated at 1% APR for the first €15,000, yes, now only for the first 12 months. Then at 0.1% APR.
This entity, paradoxically part of the Santander group, offers its checking account with everything free (account, debit card, normal transfers, Bizum, and all Banco Santander ATMs can withdraw money) in exchange for nothing.
It is one of the few entities that allows you to go to an office (Santander) to withdraw cash (in addition to Santander ATMs) at no cost.
In addition, they periodically launch a campaign that gives you around €40 as a welcome gift (you have until December 17 to take advantage of this promo, see here).
And if you have a payroll, it offers you a greater bonus:
You can sign up for the account first (€40 bonus) and then domiciliate the payroll (you choose between a 5% account or a welcome bonus). This way, you get both promotions.
The entity offers a savings account that pays up to 0.2% APR (with payroll) or, if not, at a ridiculous interest of 0.05% APR.
A few months ago he made his account free for everyone, without any requirements (see here)
Its great advantages, in addition to no commissions and no ties, are:
The downside is that it has very few offices (but there are more than practically the rest of the banks that, even if they have offices, do not allow you to go unless you pay).
This is another entity that gives you everything for free in exchange for nothing: account, card, transfers and all the ATMs in the world to withdraw money (once a month).
It also has the friend plan in which you can take up to €150 depending on the links you contract.
The Banco Sabadell online bank offers a free account and debit card with free cash withdrawals at a wide network of ATMs.
It seems unbelievable, but yes, BBVA has an account without commissions and without ties. It is the Online Account.
Of course, it is only for new customers. We former clients know that they have been able to contract it, but they have to pay for the cards.
CaixaBank's online bank (yes, CaixaBank), without commissions and without ties.
It offers the typical: account, cards, transfers and free bizum.
It is the most recommended entity and generates great trust among its clients. It also offers its Payroll Account for people who do not have a payroll. In exchange, it requires monthly income of at least €700 from another entity.
You will have an account, card and normal transfers at no cost, and you will be able to withdraw cash at a wide range of ATMs and even stores with your Twyp APP.
Additionally, if you have a payroll, the entity usually has the Amigo Plan, in which it gives you €50 (currently in force until February 28).
It has the Orange account which is remunerated, but even more ridiculous than Openbank, at 0.01% APR.
We said about OrangeBank that it had the but of the FGD, here we would say the same: it is Dutch (we repeat, for many it is not a but but rather an advantage).
BE CAREFUL that ING recently requires a condition or will charge a commission on your Orange account if you do not have a payroll account (see here).
Bankinter also offers you an account without commissions, and without the need for payroll, but requires links:
And if you have a payroll, much easier:
The prize is not bad at all. Plus everything free. It pays you well during the first 2 years and for a maximum of €5,000
In total there are €350 of interest that the account can generate.
If you want an account without fees, cards, transfers and withdraw cash at any ATM in the world for free, you have to direct deposit a payroll or pension into Pibank.
If you don't do it, you will only have a paid account, although quite well paid, at 0.5% APR.
Accounts proposed by our readers that we add here because they are also interesting:
Abanca Clara Account: No demands and with everything free, included, transfers and Bizum. Additionally, if you domiciliate the payroll before February 28, 2021, it gives you €150.
Cajamar Wefferente Account: No demands and no commissions and as a great advantage you can withdraw cash from €50 for free at any ATM.
N26 Account: It has a Spanish Iban that does not charge you for anything and does not ask you for anything.
This time we are going to get wet and choose, but we would not choose just one bank, but several or all:
And you? Leave us a comment.

953,Deutsche Bank does not pay all clients the €20/month of its Payroll promotion in February,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/deutsche-bank-no-ingresa-los-20e-mensuales-de-su-promocion-nomina-en-febrero/,15/02/2021,"Users and clients of Deutsche Bank are writing to us complaining that the bank has not paid them their €20 for the month of February from its Payroll Account promotion.
The entity pays €20 for 12 months to its clients (on the 11th of each month) who opened their account and direct deposited the payroll, as long as they meet certain conditions on a monthly basis.
One of these conditions is the monthly payroll income; Well, the month of January ended on a Sunday, and some payrolls did not come in until February 1, and for that reason they have not received the €20 for this month.
The bank's response to its clients who have complained (and which it has sent to us) has been strictly: ""if in the month of January no payroll was paid into the account, that month has not generated the right to bonus of 20 euros.
In fact, the fact that the payroll has not been paid on Sunday could even be the fault of the bank itself, because its computer system does not update the data on non-business days (Sunday). The money could be in the bank, but it has not been reflected in your accounts.
We consider that it is a bad practice, which together with the exclusion of foreigners and those not born in Spain from this promotion (see here), causes this entity to lose many points.
For our part, we will try to put as much pressure as possible on the bank and echo your complaints.
We have already contacted the bank, and in its first response it asks for more time:
Bank's response:

October 2020 onwards:
>> More details of the promotion


As you have read, Orange Bank, a branch in Spain, offers deposits of more than 3% APR through the Raisin platform, Dutch version, and for clients in the Netherlands.
We were shocked when one of our users sent it to us via email.
Openbank continues to invent nonsense, like the previous milonga of €60 per balance increase, which we criticized at the beginning of the month of December.
This time, the entity offers a deposit with a fairly normal profitability (0.75% APR), but as if to make it excellent or attract attention, it gives you €20 in an Amazon check, if the deposit is €10,000 or more.
Renault Bank is once again late paying the interest on its account and/or deposits from the settlement for the month of June. Something similar already happened in December.
In this sense, some users have contacted us asking about the problem."
954,"From today, all Santander accounts are unified into One and its new commissions",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/desde-hoy-se-unifican-todas-las-cuentas-en-santander-one-y-sus-nuevas-comisiones/,15/02/2021,"The only thing left to transfer, and it becomes effective today, is the clients of Banco Santander's Zero 123 Account to the new Santander One account and its new commissions/conditions.
Only the “Smart Account”, the “Mini Account” and the “Basic Account” will remain for people without resources.
The Zero 123 Account, in our opinion, was the most interesting account of the entity and the majority of its clients were there who will suffer from today to pay more commissions or more links.
The transfer of clients to the new Santander One account has been gradual:
Thus, the clients of the old Día a Día account have already received their first payment of commissions (the 11th of each month) and of the other accounts according to the day of their transfer.
In any case, the bank will surely notify you days before the settlement if you have to pay commissions (if you do not comply with the links) just as it has done with the clients of the Day by Day account via SMS:
I think we have said it several times, but it never comes to mind that you will pay based on your links.
The bank defines 4 types of relationships/customer profiles for Santander One.
1. Income and payment links:
2. Product Links
3. Shareholders (1,000 bank shares)
4. Select Clients or private banking.
Depending on your links, you will have to pay more or less:
The bank establishes 3 possibilities:
Fulfilling one of the 2:
If you are a customer and want to continue, enter your links and we will tell you what they will charge you or what else you have to do to avoid having to pay commissions:
This would be the most sensible decision. Leave a bank that has offered a lot (well used), but now will charge you double.
There are many alternatives:
The first thing you have to collect is the information of all the receipts that you have direct deposited in the Santander account to move it to another bank.
To change, there are 2 alternatives:
You can leave any bank by porting in the style of telephone companies.
You go to the recipient bank where you want to take the things, you fill out a form with everything and it will take care of everything. You don't have to do anything else, you don't even have to set foot in a Santander office.
The danger is that you will not be able to protest if Santander charges you any commission (in the process). It will come in the liquidation.
Furthermore, it is possible that during the process a problem arises (stocks, credit cards) and the account is not closed correctly or on time, so you will be charged a commission starting next Monday.

Before going to the bank you have to:
On the day of the appointment you can cancel the account without problems.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
955,Pibank's immediate and free transfers are now back,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-transferencias-inmediatas-y-gratuitas-de-pibank-ya-esta-de-vuelta/,15/02/2021,"Pibank's immediate transfers are now available to its clients again, after 3 weeks out of service for maintenance tasks.
The bank suspended this service on or before January 21, 2021, leaving its customers unable to make immediate transfers.
There were customers who thought that the bank had removed the service, but the entity clarified in a tweet that this service would remain in force.
And finally last Thursday, February 11, the bank once again offered this free service for its clients.
It's been exactly 3 weeks. Many of you will think that it is a long time but if you look at the case of Evo Banco, it has been without the service since June 2019 due to some ""technical adjustments"" (see here).
ECO to a user complaint about the bank
Currently the entities that allow this operation are (that we know of), and the money arrives in the destination account in about 10 seconds:

If you make the transfers before 1:00 p.m., it arrives the same day

If you make transfers before 2 p.m., they arrive the same day
The Payment Service law indicates that in bank transfers in the European Union and in Euros, at most, the money must arrive the next business day.
But be careful, that does not mean that when you request a transfer, the money has to arrive the next day (business day or not), the key, the bank's cut-off time.
The cut-off time is the time that marks whether a transfer is executed on the day the transfer is requested or the next business day.
More concretely:
Once the transfer has been executed, the money will arrive the next business day at the latest. There are banks that send the money on the same day, such as ING or Evo Banco.
The money will normally be entered into the destination account first thing in the day, but it would also be valid for it to be entered into the account at 11:59 p.m.
For the purposes of business days, all commercial opening days on which the TARGET payment system of the European Union operates are considered.
This excludes Saturdays, Sundays and national, regional and local holidays, as well as TARGET closing days (January 1, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May 1, December 25 and 26).
They are taken into account depending on where the accounts have been opened, both origin and destination of the transfer.
It does not matter where the transfer order is executed (ATM, Internet, etc.), the business days taken into account are those of the location where the source and destination accounts of the money have been opened.
If an account has been opened from the Internet, the business days of the location where the entity's Headquarters are located are considered.
In this way, for example, ING Direct is considered Madrid business days (See more in the image on the right).


Yesterday, February 14, the European Parliament adopted new rules to ensure that bank transfers reach the accounts of individuals and companies in the EU immediately.
The most significant thing for clients is that banks cannot charge higher than normal transfers.
It is said that ""in the absence of bread, cakes are good."" Well, there are banks that do not offer immediate transfers, but in exchange, they offer their clients same-day transfers.
BONUS: Get immediate transfers between ""any"" bank using Bizum.
Bankinter charges €12 commission for a simple immediate transfer, oh, and €10 for a same-day transfer. The most expensive without a doubt of all the banks.
Not even the payroll exempts from these neon commissions."

And Evo?",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/bankinter-cobra-12e-de-comision-por-las-transferencias-inmediatas-y-10e-en-el-dia-y-evo/,12/02/2021,"Bankinter charges €12 commission for a simple immediate transfer, oh, and €10 for a same-day transfer. The most expensive without a doubt of all the banks.
Even if you have your payroll in the bank, the entity does not exempt you from these commissions, according to what a user and client of the bank tells us, even though it says on its website that ""All national transfers made through bankinter.com have no commission."" ».
It is free only for normal transfers, which take between 1 or 2 business days depending on whether you make the transfers before or after the cut-off time, which in the case of Bankinter is 6:00 p.m.
When you are going to make a transfer through its electronic banking, the bank notifies you of the following 3 options:
Except that in a situation of extreme need, no one, absolutely no one in their right mind is going to pay €10 or €12 to get the money a little sooner, when there are other banks that offer this service completely free.
As a curiosity, as soon as Evo Banco was acquired by Bankinter, they removed the immediate and free transfers according to them due to some technical adjustments (see here).
Thus, it has not offered this service since June 2019 and the bank promises and re-promises that they will return, meanwhile a year and a half has passed and customers have almost forgotten about this service.
Of course, at least it allows transfers on the day (before 2:00 p.m.).
ING and Self Bank (currently also Evo Banco, until 2 p.m.) offer the same-day transfer service: if you make a transfer before 1 p.m. on a business day, the money will arrive at its destination on the same day .
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."

At the moment it is not possible. At least during the registration process, you are required to have a mobile line from the entity (prepaid or contract).
It is the entry toll that must be paid to be part of this entity that offers everything for free and high profitability.
Of course, the General Director of the entity has assured that before the end of 2021, it can be contracted by all clients.
As we say here and on various occasions, currently the Orange mobile line is only necessary in the registration process. Once you are a customer, you can remove yourself as an Orange customer.
In this sense, the ""we help you"" team at Orange Bank has spoken: ""the entity requires that you be an Orange customer to register, but if you later change companies you can continue being an Orange Bank customer, with the only drawback being that you would not be able to benefit from future promotions for Orange customers.
Thus, you can become a customer at no cost and without ties to Orange in the following way:
Once you finish the 3 steps, you can do what you want with the Orange card:
Logically, the most interesting option is the second. There is no cost, you don't have to do anything, and if a promotion comes up...
But in short, you can be Orange Bank customers, without being an Orange customer; although during the process you had to be (1 week at most).
At the end of the year, all this nonsense will no longer be necessary. Of course, its connection with Orange will never disappear, and will always be the burden of this bank, because Orange is not very liked by a significant part of its former clients.
Orange Bank offers until March 31, 2021, in its #Movilizad@s promotion a €25 bonus to new customers who sign up for the account and do the following:
The bank requires that you be a customer of an Orange contract mobile line during the registration process and you have 60 days from when you become a customer to get the €25 bonus.
Orange Bank deposits you immediately into your account every time you perform any of the above actions.
It is the only account that is remunerated at 1% APR (the most profitable) and for an indefinite period currently on the market:


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

Dear Customer:
In relation to the Remunerated Account that you maintain with EBN Banco de Negocios, S.A., we inform you that as of May 1, 2021, new conditions will apply and both the interest rate and the maximum amount to be remunerated will change.
Therefore, the remuneration of the Account will drop from a current remuneration to 0.30% APR* (0.29% TIN), for accounts with a minimum average daily balance from €3,000 to €50,000 during the calendar quarter, with quarterly settlement at a remuneration at 0.15% APR** (0.15% TIN), for accounts with a minimum average daily balance from €3,000 to €30,000 during the calendar quarter, with quarterly settlement.
Once the day of entry into force of the new conditions arrives without you having expressed your opposition to the proposed modifications, it will be understood that you accept them. In case of opposition, you may freely terminate your Account contract immediately and without any cancellation costs.

*Wizink continues to offer its former clients 0.5% APR on their savings account indefinitely.

959,Soon you will not be able to pay more than €30 with your bank card without your mobile,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/en-breve-no-podras-pagar-mas-de-30e-con-tu-tarjeta-bancaria-sin-tu-movil/,11/02/2021,"It is assumed that as of January 1, the PSD2 payment regulations came into force, which provides greater security in card payments in electronic and physical commerce as well.
But things have not happened all at once, but we will see the effects little by little. This regulation serves to prevent fraud when paying by card and make purchases safer.
This reinforced authentication system will require the use of at least 2 of the 3 systems proposed by the regulations:
The simplest thing for customers would be PIN + SMS (it does not require installing anything additional and works on any mobile phone). In the case of biometric data, a Smartphone would be required on which to install a bank APP.
The rule also affects physical purchases. But in this case, the bank or mobile card with NFC (point 1) and PIN (point 2) or in certain cases or fingerprint or biometric data (point 3) would be sufficient.
No, for online purchases, payments of less than €30 are not necessary. Of course, it is allowed 5 times a day or €100 in 24 hours. It can also be avoided by including payment recipients on a trusted list.
In the case of payments in physical stores with contactless, the current limit due to COVID is €50 without PIN, but the norm is €20.
It is also required to enter the PIN when 150 euros or 5 consecutive operations without PIN are accumulated.
Before, when you went to pay, to verify that you had made the purchase, you signed a signature, and of course, you had to verify that that signature belonged to the cardholder.
When entering terminals with PIN, the signature is replaced by the PIN, since it is assumed that only the person who owns the card knows their PIN (except for problems with card cloning and PIN theft).
More recently, with contactless terminals, payments of less than €20 (now €50 due to COVID) do not even need a PIN. Just bring the card closer and that's it.
In these cases, if you lose or if your card is stolen, are you exposed to them using your card and emptying your account?
Things are not so easy, currently with the new European directive PSD2, it requires you to enter the PIN when you accumulate 150 euros or 5 consecutive operations without a PIN. In addition, many banks notify you every time you make a payment with the card (SMS, APP message, email...).
In any case, in 2020 the Coordinates Institute of Governance and Applied Economics has warned that contactless cards accumulate 65% of the total fraud committed through payments with credit or debit cards.
Another point of fraud, which is even worse, is having your card details stolen. You don't realize it because you still have possession of the card, but the criminal is looting your account and there is no limit other than your balance (and the daily limit set on the card).
Until now, most online stores allow you to pay by simply entering your card information (Number, Name, Expiration Date and CVC).
With PSD2 this is partly avoided by limiting the daily amount and in each payment without reinforced validation.
Some banks, to make their cards more secure, do not record this data (Just your name) on the card. If you want this data, you have to enter your electronic banking.
As we have said, with the physical card you can easily get €150 or even more if your card details are stolen.
But consumers are not ""sold."" They can recover their money or at least part of it in 2 ways:
Banks take part of the blame for card fraud. 2 situations are considered:
1. Fraud with card still in your possession
If money is stolen from you in any way, you still have the card. The bank is responsible for the entire amount defrauded.
2. Fraud with loss of card
In this case, the bank makes you responsible for part of what was defrauded. As a kind of co-payment, and its amount is €50.
Therefore, if you lose your card, you can easily have up to €150 stolen. You lose €50 and the bank assumes the rest (€100).
The trader
If you have not received a refund of the entire amount defrauded, you can contact the seller.
Normally they will return your money, because they do not want to tarnish their image with these fraudulent operations; especially if they are large chains.
In fact, they have accepted contactless payments without PIN because it speeds up cash operations at the risk of greater fraud (which they assume).
With the data that appears on the bank cards, they can make online purchases on your behalf. To avoid this problem, several banks have launched data-free cards.
This increases security, but it is not total. But you can achieve it with the possibilities that banks now offer you.
Not long ago, to pay by card, they asked for your ID and verified your signature. Then the PIN arrived and they stopped ordering. Now, with Contactless, not even that.
But are we still safe? Could they rob us? Can we get the money back? We answer you.
One of the most demanded products in any banking entity are credit cards. There are many different options available to users and we can even find a ranking of the best debit and credit cards. In addition to financing, there are many more services that offer this type of card, but which one is the best for you? It is difficult to choose the one that best suits your needs, but not impossible. You just have to follow a series of key tips to make the right choice."
960,Today the unemployed with subsidy or RAI have received €21 more due to the increase in the IPREM,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/hoy-los-desempleados-con-subsidio-o-rai-han-cobrado-21e-mas-por-la-subida-del-iprem/,10/02/2021,"Today, February 10, was the first payment that the unemployed have received with the increase in their SEPE aid directly related to the increase in the IPREM.
It has been €21 more than what each unemployed beneficiary of the different unemployment subsidies and the Active Insertion Income (RAI) has received.
The unemployed who receive the minimum contributory benefit have also received more.
That is the effect of raising the IPREM by 5% and that the SEPE aid and limits are referenced to this index:
Amount of unemployment benefits and RAI:
Minimum amount of the benefit.
Maximum amount of the benefit.
The Multiple Effects Public Income Indicator (IPREM) is the reference index used in Spain to calculate the income threshold for the purposes of aid, scholarships, unemployment benefits, free legal assistance, subsidies...
It was the substitute for SMI that before 2004 was used as a reference for this aid.
The IPREM is updated annually and is established in the General State Budget Law.
Since its birth, the IPREM has suffered a progressive upward change and around or below the CPI. But if we compare it with the SMI, it has clearly evolved below this index.
Both indices had the same value for 2004, but in 2020, the IPREM day is at €17.93 while the SMI is at €31.57. This has serious consequences for the unemployed.
Looking at the table, in the last 16 years, beneficiaries of unemployment benefits have lost 168 euros per month when their subsidy was referenced to the IPREM instead of the SMI, 29% less: €168 less per month.
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more."

However, it left the door open for clients to renew their deposits as they matured, maintaining the same interest rate in force at that time.
Today the entity is informing all its clients of a drastic drop in the interest rate on these deposits (the SinyCon Plus deposit) that will come into effect tomorrow, February 11.
In addition, the change in the interest rate has added shorter terms (3 and 6 months) and the term of 9 months and the longer terms of 5 and 8 years have been eliminated.
The SinyCon Plus deposit was characterized by its high profitability, its impossibility of early cancellation and the possibility of being canceled by the bank.
The rest of the features are:
Yes, EBN has included this possibility in the pre-contractual information (see here), in the Other information section:

According to the Bank of Spain (BdE), ""the cancellation of the fixed-term deposit before maturity can be carried out, in accordance with the agreement, at the request of the client. The entity may also do so, if this is provided for in the contract.
In this way, the answer is YES, but it is not usual. As we have told you, it is the first deposit that we see this clause.
New customers can continue signing up for their savings account at 0.3% APR. This rate was set on July 1, 2019.
The account characteristics are:
Its contract is automatic if you make a deposit in the bank, or you can exclusively contract the account here.
It is one of the most profitable accounts on the market surpassed only by a handful of entities (see here)


EBN Banco has extended its deposits at 3.1% APR indefinitely to any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months.
This offer has been in effect since February 15 and initially had a marketing period until March 1, but as we say, it will continue indefinitely until further notice.
EBN Banco flat offer, gives you 3.1% APR for any term you choose: 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 or 36 months, and also reduces the minimum investment from €10,000 to €5,000 on the day of Valentine's Day.
However, this means a drop in rates for most terms: from 9 months, and a slight increase for short terms.
EBN bank changes the interest rate on various deposits. Its maximum profitability drops to 3.4% APR after the brief period at 3.6% APR offered during Black Friday.
That 3.4% APR is pretty decent, but not as much as the best offers on the market at 4% APR from Facto (see here) or Banco Big (see here)."

Thus, tomorrow, February 11, marks the first month and the first settlement of commissions will arrive.

In this sense, Santander is communicating via SMS to the unfortunate ones that they will have to pay commissions for the first time for this new account:
We remind you that account transfers to Santander One are being carried out progressively during the month of January and will end on February 15:
And the settlement of commissions will depend on when you were transferred to the new Santander One Account.
It depends on the links you have with the bank. The bank defines 4 types of relationships/customer profiles for Santander One.
1. Income and payment links:
2. Product Links
3. Shareholders (1,000 bank shares)
4. Select Clients or private banking.
Depending on your links, you will have to pay more or less:
The bank establishes 3 possibilities:

This would be the most sensible decision. Leave a bank that has offered a lot (well used), but now will charge you double.
There are many alternatives:
The first thing you have to collect is the information of all the receipts that you have direct deposited in the Santander account to move it to another bank.
To change, there are 2 alternatives:
You can leave any bank by porting in the style of telephone companies.
You go to the recipient bank where you want to take the things, you fill out a form with everything and it will take care of everything. You don't have to do anything else, you don't even have to set foot in a Santander office.
The danger is that you will not be able to protest if Santander charges you any commission (in the process). It will come in the liquidation.
Furthermore, it is possible that during the process a problem arises (stocks, credit cards) and the account is not closed correctly or on time, so you will be charged a commission starting next Monday.

But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."

This is quite different from other years. Thus, in 2020, the bank offered €40 to open your account without commissions (see here).
In fact, the bank has been without this promotion for 2 months and in 2020 any excuse was good to offer it: sales, Valentine's Day, Father's and Mother's Day, the arrival of summer, to extend the summer, back to school and to Christmas shopping.
Of that list, in 2021, the bank has already skipped the first 2.
We believe that now the bank thinks that offering the account without commissions and without conditions is enough attractive to attract customers, and it is not far off the mark, given how the competition is getting with the issue of commissions and conditions (see list here from banks without commissions and without conditions)
How do you get your 2×1 in Meller?
Promotion valid until February 28, 2021 (inclusive).
This is one of the 3 accounts (see here) that we know of that offers you all the services without commissions, with free cards, a wide network of ATMs and offices (Santander) where you can go to deposit and withdraw cash.

964,Ranking of banks that charged the most banking fees in 2020,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ranking-de-bancos-que-mas-comisiones-cobraron-en-2020/,09/02/2021,"Little by little, the income statement of the different banks is becoming known and is being published in the media.
In total calculation, in 2020 banks collected 10,104 million in banking fees.
These data refer to those of CaixaBank, Santander, BBVA, Bankia, Sabadell, Bankinter, Unicaja, Liberbank and Abanca. Data such as that of KutxaBank or Ibercaja would be missing.
Thus, the champion of 2020 commissions is CaixaBank, which received 2,330 million euros in commissions, and closely followed by Banco Santander with 2,314 million. The rest already at a certain distance.
In this way, in 2020, CaixaBank surpassed Santander, which had the first position in 2019 as the bank that charged the most fees.
Logically, this is the accumulated commissions. It does not mean that the bank charges more commissions for each client.
Most banks have grown in the commissions charged in 2020 compared to 2019, except for Banco Santander, and curiously Banco Sabadell, because at the beginning of 2020 it began to charge commissions even in its expansion account (see here).
These commissions are net from 2020 and include commissions paid by companies, those associated with wholesale banking, and commissions applied to retail clients.
Not only are there commissions for bank accounts, but also for marketing insurance, investment funds, SICAVs and pension plans.
Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.

The deadline ends next Monday, February 15, 2021, in which Raisin gives double the bonus for making a deposit on its platform.
It is a promotion, which is not compatible with other promotions, it is aimed at new customers who, depending on the amount of the investment they make, can obtain a bonus of up to €200.
The minimum investment period for all products is 6 months and the bonus will be deposited:
This promotion will be available only to new customers until February 15, 2021, after which the bonus will be halved.
We do not recommend anyone make a deposit in a single bank above what is covered by the FGD, which is €100,000 per entity (Raisin does not allow it either).
This platform currently has 19 collaborating entities from more than 10 countries with returns of up to 1.36% APR.
Some of the banks that offer the best profitability on the platform are:
We remind you that deposits are contracted in these banks, and that Raisin is a mere intermediary. Thus, the money is deposited in the countries to which each bank belongs and its consequences:
Some of our users have asked us why Raisin is not included in the records of the Bank of Spain.
And so, it is, because according to Raisin, its business model does not require any authorization/license to operate in Spain.
Your money when transferred to Raisin, is deposited in Raisin Bank based in Germany and under the German FGD.
Once you contract a deposit, the money will be deposited in the collaborating bank and under the FGD of origin of said bank.


BluOr Bank AS or Blue Orange as we knew it before, is an entity that offers its deposits through the Raisin platform, has increased the profitability of its 6-month deposit to 4.11% APR.
This profitability, which is the most profitable on the market, exceeding the 4.06% APR of the Facto Account, is not yet listed on the Raisin website, but will be soon. One of our affiliate companies has communicated this to us.
Banco Progetto, an Italian entity, which offers deposits of up to 3.43% APR, has announced that it is temporarily not accepting new applications.
Novum Bank, an entity from Malta, and WITHOUT a branch in Spain, offers a deposit at a high interest, 2.5% APR, and a one-year term.
It would be similar to Wizink, Facto or EBN, but much shorter term. The bad thing is that the money would be abroad and what it entails."
966,"Having payroll, receipts, cards and MORTGAGE will not exempt you from paying €60 commission at Unicaja",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/tener-nomina-recibos-tarjetas-e-hipoteca-no-eximira-de-pagar-60e-de-comision-en-unicaja/,08/02/2021,"There was BBVA, which asks for something more than the payroll so as not to pay commissions, but was content with the use of cards and receipts.
Then there was Banco Santander and Banco Sabadell, which demand, in addition to BBVA, they ask for insurance or a pension plan or an investment fund or a loan (see here a comparison of their commissions).
In this way, the bulk of the clients of these ""immobilized"" banks, those who have a mortgage with the bank, were freed from the new commissions. We say immobilized because moving a mortgage is not a simple thing.
But Unicaja goes one step further, and WILL NOT EXEMPT this group of clients from commissions in its Zero Commission Plan, and will charge them €5 per month in commissions, €60 per year starting March 15, 2021.
If you do not have a mortgage, and you are not going to meet the conditions, it is best that you leave the bank for another that does not charge anything or at least that you can meet the conditions. See alternatives below.
The bad thing is those who have a mortgage, and it will be difficult to escape their commissions, unless you take the step and decide to subrogate your mortgage to another entity (there are expenses).
There is a way to avoid having to pay commissions, and that is to remove everything from the bank and leave a checking account exclusively for the payment of fees (via transfer from another bank). The bank cannot charge you commissions (conditions of good banking practices of the BdE). If they do, they complain and they have to pay you back.
But of course, mortgages usually require at least linking you to your payroll. If you remove everything, your mortgage will be penalized and if you leave the payroll, you will have to pay commissions.
Those who took out a mortgage, home insurance as a link in addition to the payroll, are free of commissions, and will continue as before.
1. €120 commission
No ties. €10 monthly commission for the account.
2. €60 commission
If you meet one of the following conditions:
3. No commissions (zero commission plan).
Meet the following 3 conditions:
>> See zero commission plan
It is difficult for many savers to have the investment products that Unicaja requires to be exempt from commissions.
The most sensible decision will be to leave, and there are alternatives:



Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are, but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost.
But we tell you how to stay in the bank.
As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.
We tell you a way to get rid of commissions in these cases."
967,ING will continue spending €100 per payroll in February with everything free,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/ing-seguira-gastando-en-febrero-100e-por-capta-una-nomina-en-su-plan-amigo/,05/02/2021,"ING has extended until February 28 its friend plan in which it offers €50 to an ING client (sponsor) with a payroll account, who brings a friend (godson) to the entity and direct debits a payroll, with the friend also taking €50 €.
In this way, for the orange entity the cost for each payroll collected is €100.
They are not the only banks that want to capture payroll, in the market there are offers of up to €480 (see best offers here) to try to seduce you into taking your payroll to their bank.
Logically, all these offers are to give you an account without commissions, unlike banks like Santander, BBVA, Banco Sabadell, CaixaBank or Bankia, which even taking your payroll is not enough to avoid paying commissions (up to €240 commission), you have to link more (see here).
As we have said, ING offers €50 to both the godfather and the godson who maintains a payroll in addition to offering all services for free.
To qualify for this promotion, the godson must meet the following 2 points:
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 500 euros.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
>> More information.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income."
968,MyInvestor will allow transfers to Renaul Bank in the coming days,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/myinvestor-permitira-transferencias-a-renaul-bank-en-los-proximos-dias/,05/02/2021,"MyInvestor has told us that transfers from your bank to Renault Bank will work in the coming days, without specifying a date.
According to what the entity's communications manager (A.A.F) told us, they are carrying out ""procedures with Renault Bank"" in order to obtain ""their BIC number and be able to issue payments safely.""
It shouldn't take long to do that. But we will see...
Several users have written to us saying that MyInvestor (but you can read many more cases in the forums) does not allow them to make a transfer to a Renault Bank account, an entity with a Spanish IBAN.
These same users contacted the bank and told them that there was an internal incident, that they will try to solve it, but days go by and it remains the same.
If you are in a hurry to move the money, the easy solution would be to transfer it to another bank as an intermediary (that is a client and does not charge a commission for transfers) and from there move it to Renault Bank.
It is a slightly slower process, but at the end of the day, the desired result can be achieved.
The reason is simple, because MyInvestor will shortly (April 1) cut the interest rate on your savings account from 1% APR to 0.1% APR.
The 1% APR will be available only for new customers and for an initial period of 12 months.
Renault Bank offers 2 products of interest:
Transfers (normal, immediate ones are not available at the moment) are also free, but only to an associated account (with you as the owner).
The account only allows a single owner.
It is a big drawback that they do not allow early cancellations.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"
969,Deutsche Bank excludes the €480 promo for foreigners and those not born in Spain. Discrimination?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/deutsche-bank-excluye-la-promo-480e-por-nomina-a-extranjeros-y-no-nacidos-en-espana-discriminacion/,04/02/2021,"We are in the 21st century and we continue to see people being discriminated against because of their place of birth or their nationality.
We have recently come across a case that seems to be an example of this discrimination, or at least those who have suffered it have felt that way.
This is Deutsche Bank's promotion in which it gives €480 as a welcome gift to new customers who bring a payroll to the bank (see here).
This offer is exclusively for (according to your requirements, see here, section 1): ""natural person, of legal age, with ID, born and resident in Spain.""
That is, it excludes:
Ah, but when the bank publishes its exclusions (section 2), it hides, for a reason, points 4 and 5 of the previous paragraph:
Those exclusions that we say are included in point 1 (if the conditions of section 1 are not met), but it does specify the issue of minors under 18 years of age and non-residents, which was also in section 1.
Of course, it is very bad to say: foreigners and those born abroad are excluded.
We have been chasing them for 3 days to get an explanation, which has not yet arrived.
We have contacted the bank through the Facebook wall (2 days ago), and they told us that they did not respond in Spanish (in one of their publications in our language).
We asked it again in English (yesterday) and they told us to go to their email.
Today we received an email, without having sent anything, from a person from Evercom, a digital communication and strategy agency, which we imagine is dealing with this issue of Deutsche Bank in Spain.
In his email, instead of giving us the appropriate explanations, they want to call us by ""phone to give you information about the requirements for contracting a Deutsche Bank online payroll account.""
We never talk to banks over the phone (to avoid the ""if I told you or I didn't tell you"" thing).
We have requested information again via email (at 8:51), and there is still no response (will be added when we receive it).
NOTE: Evercom response received after publication: «The contracting process for the More DB Payroll Account is exclusively digital and automated. Digital registration is completed based on the data entered by clients and Deutsche Bank's risk criteria. In case it cannot be completed, at Deutsche Bank we are happy to pay attention in our offices and inform you about the products that best suit the profile and needs of each client.
But that does not explain the issue of exclusions for foreigners and those not born in Spain.
Furthermore, if you go to an office and try to take advantage of the promotion, according to the same discriminated users, they tell you that it cannot be done, it has to be done digitally.
Several users have shown interest in this product and due to their nationality or place of birth, the bank has rejected their request.
These people, who have felt discriminated against, have contacted us, and from here we raise their voices so that people know what is happening even in the 21st century.


As you have read, Orange Bank, a branch in Spain, offers deposits of more than 3% APR through the Raisin platform, Dutch version, and for clients in the Netherlands.
We were shocked when one of our users sent it to us via email.
Openbank continues to invent nonsense, like the previous milonga of €60 per balance increase, which we criticized at the beginning of the month of December.
This time, the entity offers a deposit with a fairly normal profitability (0.75% APR), but as if to make it excellent or attract attention, it gives you €20 in an Amazon check, if the deposit is €10,000 or more.
Renault Bank is once again late paying the interest on its account and/or deposits from the settlement for the month of June. Something similar already happened in December.
In this sense, some users have contacted us asking about the problem."
970,"Kwh of electricity is now worth half what it was in January. Benefit, but only if you have the PVPC",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/kwh-de-luz-vale-ahora-la-mitad-que-en-enero-beneficiate-pero-solo-si-tienes-la-pvpc/,04/02/2021,"During the month of January, it was reported in all written and electronic media that the price of electricity was at historic highs (almost doubling the price of previous months) due to the Filomena storm.
However, this news, and unfortunately (yes, you will see why), does NOT affect half of the homes that have a free market rate.
These price fluctuations exclusively and directly affect those who have the PVPC rate (The Voluntary Price of the Small Consumer), the rate regulated by the Government.
Despite this impressive news, this cost when passed on to consumers is not so disproportionate, because among other things, more than half of our bill are: fixed costs (power, meter rental, services), taxes and fees.
Thus, in my case (the one who writes), I received the following invoice (you can compare it with yours):
About €10 more than previous months, and it is a value very similar to what would come out with the CNMC simulator (the difference is due to the fact that the invoice is priced by hour and CNMC makes an average).
Compare it with your free market invoice (you will see how you have paid more even though it has increased me by €10).

The average daily price with time discrimination in the month of January reached maximums of €0.17 per kWh.
In the last week of January, the average daily price dropped to a minimum of €0.037 per kWh. Normal figures are 0.05 to 0.09 Kwh. You haven't seen any posts about this!
In fact, the consumption price of my 279 Kwh if I had spent it between January 20 (still includes very expensive days of that month) and February 4, it would have dropped from €31.66 to €23.99. If you add taxes to that money, the savings would be about €10.
If you are NOT in the PVPC, you are probably paying more on your electricity bill. They are all aimed at making you switch to the free market, and hiding the existence of this regulated rate.
If you want to know why PVPC is cheaper, we have written quite a bit (see here).
If you still don't trust it, you can check it yourself by going to the CMNC website or leaving us your information below in the comments (similar to the image a little above) and we'll calculate it for you.
The new 2.0TD electricity rate will come into effect next Tuesday, June 1, which will be more expensive and will have time discrimination.
The PVPC is the cheapest rate in most cases (up to €200 cheaper per year), with the change it will continue to be so, but you will have to pay something more.
It seemed strange to us that politicians were going to legislate for the benefit of consumers and taxpayers or the majority of them.
It would have been like this if they had maintained the prices and forced everyone to use the time-sensitive rate.
What it is really going to do is equalize everyone, making those who currently pay less pay more, the time discrimination thing.
In the month of April 2021, the new electricity rate (2.0 TD) will come into effect, which will have time discrimination for everyone and will benefit many people.
We tell you why, and what the new 2021 electricity rate will be like."
971,Have you paid commissions at CaixaBank for the 2nd time? We tell you how to avoid them,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/has-pagado-comisiones-en-caixabank-por-2a-vez-te-decimos-como-evitarlas/,03/02/2021,"CaixaBank has recently charged commissions for its ""day by day"" program for the second time.
It was specifically on January 31, 2021, and the previous time, on October 31, 2020. Every 3 months they make these charges to your bank accounts.
If you are one of these clients, do not continue paying, there are 3 ways to avoid having to bear these charges for having a simple bank account.
You must meet the following 2 conditions:

If you have paid commissions it is because you are missing 1 or 2 links:
You are still in Caixa Bank, but you are going to an online account with everything free:
The downside we found is that it only allows a single owner and a single account per owner.
And if you are hesitant because you like being able to go to their offices, forget it, because even if you are a Family Account customer or are part of CaixaBank's ""day by day"" program, every time you go to their offices, they will charge you 2 euros per operation. Well, except for those over 65 years of age, who are allowed to do 4 a month without charging them.
In our opinion it is the best option. There are other entities that await you with open arms, without commissions, without conditions and/or others even give you welcome bonuses.
There are many offers and it would make this article very extensive, so we leave you a link to those offers:
There is nothing that can tie you forever in a bank: a mortgage can be subrogated, an investment fund, shares, etc., can be transferred.
In any case, if you keep an account open exclusively for the payment of mortgage payments, for example, you cannot be charged commissions according to the Bank of Spain's code of good practices.
But if you don't want to fight with the bank, go to ImaginBank.


CaixaBank will give Bankia's online customers a good blow by requiring them to comply with the Day by Day program to be exempt from commissions (up to €240 per year).
From not having to comply with anything at all, to having to direct deposit the income in addition to receipts or use your cards to continue at no cost.
But don't worry, there are many alternatives to go to. We have found up to 11.
CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022.
The POINTS aid, or family aid for children or benefit for dependent children, is officially collected on the 16th of July and January.
However, there are entities that have already advanced the payment of the aid as of June 25, 2021. We have been able to see the details of the payment from both Banco Santander and Openbank"

These same users contacted the bank and told them that there was an internal incident, that they will try to solve it, but the days go by and it remains the same.
From the response that the bank is giving to its clients, it seems that its system does not have Renault Bank registered as the recipient of a transfer.
For these people it is as if a corralito were being applied to them, since it does not allow them to move their money to another bank in this case Renault Bank with a Spanish IBAN and BIC as is legislated.

From the information we have (thanks to the contribution of one of our users), the bank offers between €100 and €246 as a welcome fee depending on the ministry to which you belong.
For example:
As a condition, the entity requires:
Except for Ministry of Labor workers (as far as we know), the offer is the same as that offered to other clients (€100 gross).
The process, according to the bank, is very easy. You must go to any BBVA office with your ID and your latest payroll. It will tell you what the current offer is for you, and if you want, you can register and take advantage of the promotion.
NOTE: for some groups there is a link to their website to join the offer (request in comments and it will be sent to you via email).

974,The best and most profitable savings accounts of the month of February 2021,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/las-mejores-cuentas-ahorro-y-mas-rentables-del-mes-de-febrero-de-2021/,03/02/2021,"In the month of January 2021 we suffered a significant cut. The MyInvestor savings account stopped paying 1% APR for an indefinite period (see here).
Starting in April, it will be an exclusively interesting product for new customers with the same profitability (1% APR), but for old customers, they will only pay 0.1% APR, very low compared to other offers on the market.
It is the opposite of what Wizink is doing, which maintains 0.5% APR for its clients prior to August 2020 (see here), while giving new ones only 0.1% APR.
The rest of the products remain unchanged, with the most profitable account in February 2021 being that of Orange Bank (and MyInvestor for new clients), at 1% APR for €20,000 followed by Renault Bank, at 0.65% APR.
*MyInvestor offers 1% APR only to new clients for 12 months, the rest at 0.1% APR
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients 0.5% APR on their savings account indefinitely.
It is the most profitable thing that can be achieved now in a savings account, the bad thing is that it can only be contracted by customers with an Orange mobile line (at the end of 2021 it will no longer be necessary), although it is not a big problem either, you can become a customer of prepaid (we have done it and it has involved no cost).
Furthermore, once you register, you do not have to continue being an Orange customer. You can throw away the orange card.
The account offers a Spanish IBAN but under the French FGD and has a limited maximum amount to be paid:
It is also giving a €25 bonus to new customers who link their card with a payment application and use it (see here).
It is the most profitable and under the Spanish FGD, the bad thing is that it is limited to the first €15,000, but as we say it is only during the first year that you become a customer.
Once this period has passed, the remuneration is only 0.1% APR.
The account characteristics are:
Entity that begins to operate in Spain today with the opening of an online branch (Spanish IBAN). It will be the same as ING in its beginnings.
It will offer a high-yield savings account and deposit under the French FGD:
Under the Spanish FGD. This is the online branch of Banco Pichincha, offering 0.2 percentage points more than its physical banking. Be careful, that can change:
It also has deposits of up to 0.8% APR. Furthermore, if you open the payroll account you would have all the services.
With Spanish FGD, Wizink offers 0.5% APR on accounts opened before August 1, 2020:
NN Bank plans to lower the profitability of its account to 0.3% APR on January 21, 2021 (see details here)
This account is under the Dutch FGD:
This is the only account with a foreign IBAN. The money is in Holland and is not subject to withholding. The client must declare the interest in the income tax return.
Furthermore, since the money is abroad, if you have more than €50,000 outside of Spain you have to complete form 720 annually.
Since July, EBN offers its account at 0.3% APR under the Spanish FGD.
It usually has high-profit deposits, but its marketing is now suspended.
It is the same as Pibank, but with offices and lower profitability.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"
975,CaixaBank charges €36 a year for the debit card even for linked customers,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/caixabank-cobra-36e-al-ano-por-la-tarjeta-de-debito-incluso-a-clientes-vinculados-con-nomina-cuenta-family/,02/02/2021,"We already warned months ago (see here) that CaixaBank charged €36 a year in fees for its debit cards, even from linked clients without fees.
It also charges €31 commission for each additional debit card requested.
These commissions were set on April 20, 2020: starter, from €28 to €36 and additional, from €23 to €31.
The only cards that the entity exempts from paying commissions to its linked customers are credit cards, which give greater benefits to the bank every time you make a payment with it.
The normal thing is that you haven't even noticed the change, because the bank sent a credit card, the Visa & Pay card, to replace the debit card you had.
But be careful, you must continue to comply with its conditions, because otherwise the commissions are even higher than the debit commission.
To be exempt from paying credit card fees, you must meet the following 2 conditions:

If you do not meet the 2 conditions, you will have to pay commissions:
In total you could pay €288 a year for the account and a credit card.
The most important thing is to configure the card with full payment, NEVER deferred payment. This way, there will be no interest to pay.
The normal thing is that the consumption charge is charged in arrears, but the card we are talking about in question, the Visa & Pay card (the default card that comes with the Payroll Account), the charge is after 2 days to make the purchase.
As an advantage, the bank allows you to use the money you have in the account, in addition to the credit assigned to the card.
But the benefit is for the Bank, which will earn much more each time you make a payment.
As we have said on other occasions, if for some reason you want to continue with CaixaBank, switch to ImaginBank.
You will continue to be part of CaixaBank and with all (the same) services:
The downside we found is that it only allows a single owner and a single account per owner.
And if you hesitate because you like to be able to go to their offices, forget it, because even if you are clients of the CaixaBank Family Account, every time you go to their offices, they will charge you 2 euros per operation. Well, except for those over 65 years of age, who are allowed to do 4 a month without charging them.


CaixaBank will give Bankia's online customers a good blow by requiring them to comply with the Day by Day program to be exempt from commissions (up to €240 per year).
From not having to comply with anything at all, to having to direct deposit the income in addition to receipts or use your cards to continue at no cost.
But don't worry, there are many alternatives to go to. We have found up to 11.
CaixaBank will make Bankia customers pay €36 per year for their debit card starting January 1, 2022.
The POINTS aid, or family aid for children or benefit for dependent children, is officially collected on the 16th of July and January.
However, there are entities that have already advanced the payment of the aid as of June 25, 2021. We have been able to see the details of the payment from both Banco Santander and Openbank"

The entity has extended the offer until March 31, 2021, but cutting the bonus to €25:
The current offer is aimed at new customers who sign up for an Orange Bank account with an Orange contract mobile line before March 31, 2021.
What we don't know is if this time, former customers can also benefit. The only thing we can assure is that what those who benefited from the previous campaign will be left out.
These users will have 60 days from when they become customers to get the €25 bonus.
Orange Bank deposits you immediately into your account every time you perform any of the above actions.
It is the only account that is remunerated at 1% APR (the most profitable) and for an indefinite period currently on the market:
The Orange Bank account is exclusively for customers with an Orange mobile line (prepaid or contract).


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

This obligation was established in the eleventh rule of Circular 5/2012, of June 27, of the Bank of Spain (BdE), in order to achieve transparency in banking services and responsibility in the granting of loans, and they must send it in January.
It is applicable to both credit and deposit operations, as well as any service or product linked to the above, as detailed by the Bank of Spain.
This communication must arrive by postal mail, unless the client has expressly waived this possibility, in which case it will be by digital means: email or notifications from electronic or mobile banking.
It is personalized and individualized information, which must be sent to you even if you have closed the account during the year.
We are clients of several banks and we can tell you that we have received from the following banks (we have also added contributions from our users:
From what some users tell us, receiving the statement from Wizink in the early hours of February 1. We received it on January 31st around 10 p.m.
We have not been able to verify the non-compliance of any bank. And you? leave us a comment.

Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are, but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost.
But we tell you how to stay in the bank.
As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.

978,Immediate transfers from Pibank in maintenance. Let it not be like in Evo!,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/transferenias-inmeditas-de-pibank-en-mantenimiento-que-no-sea-como-en-evo/,01/02/2021,"Pibank has not been able to make immediate and free transfers since at least January 21, 2021 due to maintenance tasks.
The entity clarifies in a tweet that this service will remain in force, in the meantime you must use ordinary transfers (SEPA), which take 1 business day (see cut-off time below) for the money to appear at its destination.
Let's hope that this maintenance is much shorter than Evo Banco, which has been in place since June 2019. We have written it well, since JUNE 2019 without the service due to some ""technical adjustments"" (see here).
Currently the entities that allow this operation are (that we know of), and the money arrives in the destination account in about 10 seconds:

If you make the transfers before 1:00 p.m., it arrives the same day

If you make transfers before 2 p.m., they arrive the same day
The Payment Service law indicates that in bank transfers in the European Union and in Euros, at most, the money must arrive the next business day.
But be careful, that does not mean that when you request a transfer, the money has to arrive the next day (business day or not), the key, the bank's cut-off time.
The cut-off time is the time that marks whether a transfer is executed on the day the transfer is requested or the next business day.
More concretely:
Once the transfer has been executed, the money will arrive the next business day at the latest. There are banks that send the money on the same day, such as ING or Evo Banco.
The money will normally be entered into the destination account first thing in the day, but it would also be valid for it to be entered into the account at 11:59 p.m.
For the purposes of business days, all commercial opening days on which the TARGET payment system of the European Union operates are considered.
This excludes Saturdays, Sundays and national, regional and local holidays, as well as TARGET closing days (January 1, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May 1, December 25 and 26).
They are taken into account depending on where the accounts have been opened, both origin and destination of the transfer.
It does not matter where the transfer order is executed (ATM, Internet, etc.), the business days taken into account are those of the location where the source and destination accounts of the money have been opened.
If an account has been opened from the Internet, the business days of the location where the entity's Headquarters are located are considered.
In this way, for example, ING Direct is considered Madrid business days (See more in the image on the right).


Yesterday, February 14, the European Parliament adopted new rules to ensure that bank transfers reach the accounts of individuals and companies in the EU immediately.
The most significant thing for clients is that banks cannot charge higher than normal transfers.
It is said that ""in the absence of bread, cakes are good."" Well, there are banks that do not offer immediate transfers, but in exchange, they offer their clients same-day transfers.
BONUS: Get immediate transfers between ""any"" bank using Bizum.
Pibank's immediate transfers are now available to its clients again, after 3 weeks out of service for maintenance tasks."

It is the opposite of what the rest of the banks have done, especially the large ones (see here), even ING, the bank WITHOUT COMMISSIONS, but it is no longer so (see here).
As you know recently, Consumer Affairs and the CCAAs have established that if a bank advertises a 0 COMMISSIONS account, it must maintain it if the client demands compliance (see here).
Well, we commented that ING should comply with it with its Orange Account (see here), although it could evade, because the agreement is after its announcements of 0 commissions.
But Evo Banco is sending now, and after the agreement, an advertisement in which it clearly indicates: 0 commissions, 0 requirements.
We will see if the ""Agreement"" established by the authorities serves any purpose or is a toast to the sun, as we fear.

It is the bank's strong point, allowing free debit withdrawals from more than 16,000 ATMs with no minimum amount and no withdrawal limit:
You can also withdraw it for free at the rest of the ATMs if it is at least €120.
It also does not charge abroad for withdrawing money by debit. It is possible that the entities that own the ATM apply a fee.

The offer expired on January 31, 2021, but today (the previous deadline still appears on its website) the bank has announced its extension of the offer until February 28, 2021.
In addition, the bank has eliminated the requirement to be one of the first 5,000 new customers to take advantage of the offer. During the month of February, this limitation does not exist.
On the other hand, indicate that the €480 is not paid by the entity at once, but monthly, €20 per month for 2 years.
The requirements are:
If in a certain month you do not meet the conditions (income or use of the cards), that month the bank does not pay the €20 and the client also loses the right to receive it in the following months even if they meet the requirements.
The €20 per month are net. The bank is responsible for the corresponding income tax withholdings, so the client receives a total of €480 net.
>> More details of the promotion
The account characteristics are:
If you do not receive payroll direct debit for 3 consecutive months, you will no longer enjoy the cash withdrawal bonus at national and international ATMs.
There are 5 other banks that offer significant sums of money in exchange for payroll and little else like Deutsche Bank and, logically, without commissions.
There is a choice, you do not have to continue in your banks if the conditions have changed as Santander, CaixaBank, BBVA, Sabadell or Bankia have recently done.
At Bankinter you can get up to €400 between your friend plan: €50 (note, the promotion ends on the 29th, see here) and €350 in interest.
Specifically, the entity offers clients a 5% APR during the first year and a 2% APR in the second year for the first €5,000, which represents approximately €350 gross in interest over 2 years.
It's not that they give you €350 directly, but that they pay you all that money for only €5,000 is difficult to find these days.
This account can be contracted by both new clients and existing clients who do not yet have payroll direct deposited, requiring:
The bank also offers this same bonus to customers (Non-Payroll Account) who DO NOT have a payroll but who meet the following points:
The offer is valid until June 30, 2021
Up to €300 for clients residing in the Community of Madrid (possibly also in Asturias).
€150 for the rest of the communities with the same requirements:
In principle, if you direct your payroll to the Clara Account, it is commission-free, as stated on their website.
The offer is valid until January 31, 2021
Cajamar gives away €200 in cash if you direct a new payroll to the entity for the first time of at least €1,200.
Additionally, it requires that the payroll remain for 3 years in an account of the entity in which it is the owner or joint owner.
In the event of job loss, the bank will accept unemployment benefit as long as it is greater than €400.
The bank considers payroll when it comes from a payroll ""master/issuer"" (we understand payroll-type transfers), with (normal) transfers, cash receipts and/or payroll checks not being valid.
As we indicated, it must be the first time that a payroll is domiciled in any of the entities of the Cajamar Cooperative Group.
The offer will be valid until June 30, 2021 or until 2,000 new direct debit payrolls are reached.
Liberbank offers €150 in exchange for payroll or pension.
The requirements are:
The account is commission-free, and with free transfers. The offer will be valid until June 30, 2021
Openbank also offers a return of 5% APR for the first 6 months and for a maximum of €5,000; That is, €125 gross in interest in 6 months.
In return he demands:
Among the good things about this entity:
Later when you become customers, the bank will continue to continually offer you new promotions.


Abanca continues to offer the Now deposit to its clients with a profitability of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
This deposit, exclusively for money from other banks, is being sent to its clients via email. If you contract it with money that is already in the bank, the interest rate drops to 1.78% APR.
Abanca made the purchase of Targobank on October 6, and it is already having some effects such as the change of logo on the Targobank website.
Targobank has nearly 150,000 clients, who will be affected in some way by this acquisition, but they should not worry, just be aware of possible changes.
Abanca has been offering a deposit for selected clients for a few weeks with a return of 3.1% APR and a 12-month term.
The most peculiar thing about this product is that it pays the interest in advance, 2 days after establishing the fixed term."
981,Banking Lies: It is not logical to pay to lend. Not even us for deposits!,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/banca-no-es-logico-que-le-cueste-dinero-por-prestar-ni-nosotros-por-depositos/,28/01/2021,"In the words of José María Roldán, the president of the Spanish Banking Association (AEB), ""paying someone to borrow is a contradiction.""
He said these words a few years ago when the Euribor began to be negative, but it is especially of interest these days:
The banks see it very clearly, they consider that it is not logical that it costs them money to lend, since their business is based on obtaining returns for giving loans, which is why they reject having to pay for past mortgages.
We also do not see it logical that banks charge because we savers lend them the money (deposits) so that they can lend it again to other people.
If it is a ""contradios"" for the bank to pay for a loan, it is also a ""contradios"" for us to lend the money to the bank.
But they are manipulators and tell a lot of lies to justify themselves.
ING calls (sent in a statement, see here) the commission it will charge for deposits as a “balance custody commission.” Lie!
The bank does not guard our money. If I kept it, it would be out of balance, that is, I couldn't use our money for anything, just leave it in a safe and that's not the case.
We lend them our money for a defined time (deposit) or for an indefinite time (account) and they use the money to give loans.
Thus, ING has the following offers with more than enough margin:
As a result of the fact that they use our money for their investments, the regulator requires them to have a certain amount of money to face refunds.
That money must be kept in the ECB (which will be the reason for the next point and a new lie).
It is true that the ECB is charged for deposit facilities (0.5%). An instrument to park the liquid money of a bank.
But they put the money there, it's because they want to and they don't take all our money and deposit it there. If so, it would be logical to charge us.
What they are required to do is leave minimum reserves in the central banks, which is 1% of customer deposits.
The extra cost of that is practically negligible. For example: if a bank to raise €1,000,000 has to offer 1% APR, as is the case with Orange Bank, the annual cost would be:
For those €50 costs, they want to justify charging a commission for deposits. What does that €50 mean compared to the €10,000 of interest that the bank pays to the client?
Let's take the case of ING, which is going to charge €120 a year to a client with €30,000 in the Orange account (without a payroll account). Even if I put all that money into deposit facilities, the cost to ING would be €150.
But since it only leaves a mandatory 1%, the annual cost would be €1.5 for €30,000 or €5 for €100,000 and he wants to charge €120 for all those people.
They don't want to, but a flood of complaints is expected now that the Euribor is below -0.5%. There are many mortgages that will have negative rates, having a differential of 0.5%.
We will see what happens, but if it comes to having to pay, it is not a justification to charge now for deposits.
But they are not going to pay for the mortgages they are selling now (if that were the case, then it would be a contradiction, see the case of ING, 0.99%), but for what they sold years ago (by far below the 0.5%).
Setting an interest rate on mortgages or loans is a bet between the bank and the consumer.
The bank, which has more information than us, makes an offer that it thinks will be the winning bid (the cost will always be lower), and it almost always gets it right and wins.
But that is not happening now, due to the concatenation of economic crises and the ECB to stimulate the economy lowers rates to levels not contemplated by the banking risk analysis system. And of course, now they're losing the bet and want to change the rules mid-game.
It is as if he now sells us a deposit at 2% APR for 5 years (excellent profitability) and it turns out that within 2 years, interest rates rise to 5% and there are offers in the market for 4%. Can we claim something?
You bet, you lose, you pay. There's no more.
It is much less logical to pay for deposits (contracted now) than for loans (which were contracted years ago).


If you take a look at the digital press or do a search on the internet you will see this headline in almost all the media: BBVA, the first bank to charge for deposits.
Be careful, ING made the decision earlier to charge for deposits. We leave you a comparison of the commissions of both entities: BBVA vs ING deposit commissions.
BBVA has decided to charge a commission to its individual clients for their deposits if they have no connection with the bank.
It will not affect practically any customer, just like ING did.
We never believed that we were going to write the word commission together with ING or the Orange Account.
Of course, I had previously talked about commissions for the debit card or the non-payroll account in Germany if you stopped meeting their requirements.
But charging for the Orange Account, the iconic Orange Account that made ""your money grow day by day"", that ""if you needed your money you took it and the rest continued to grow at ING"" and an example of what it means to save (see image that can still be found online), is unheard of."
982,"After the MyInvestor snip, which account at 1% APR is better: Orange Bank or MyInvestor?",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/tras-el-tijeretazo-de-myinvestor-que-cuenta-al-1-tae-es-mejor-orange-bank-o-myinvestor/,27/01/2021,"MyInvestor will maintain the 1% APR only for new clients and for an initial period of 12 months. Then you will pay them only 0.1% APR.
Orange Bank will remain the only account at 1% APR and for an indefinite period.
If you are a new MyInvestor client, and you are only looking to make your money profitable, perhaps MyInvestor is better, because it guarantees you for 12 months at 1% APR, while Orange Bank can change the conditions at any day with a 2-month notice.
But I would take advantage of Orange Bank first, until it changes its conditions (if it does) or for the excess money that Orange Bank does not compensate me (see below).
If you are already a customer, the 1% will last until April 1 or until you reach 12 months as a bank customer. From that date, you should think about going to another bank and Orange Bank is a good alternative.
Both accounts have many similar advantages, but they have some notable differences:
Many think that you have to choose a bank as best and stay there forever; but we are never going to tell you something like that.
We believe that we must take advantage of the benefits of all banks, if they have something usable, logically.
Of course, you must take advantage of MyInvestor's initial promotion wisely.
If you have less than €20,000, make it profitable with Orange Bank. If you have more, and I would even say close to €35,000, I would also open MyInvestor to put €15,000 in this entity and have it give you that 1% APR for 12 months. Then look for another one that offers a reasonable interest (see offers here)
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

Of course, if you take the step now, make sure, by talking to the bank, that you are still among the first 5,000. Because the offer is limited to those new customers.
Furthermore, the entity does not pay the €480 at once, but monthly, €20 per month for 2 years.
The requirements are:
If in a certain month you do not meet the conditions (income or use of the cards), that month the bank does not pay the €20 and the client also loses the right to receive it in the following months even if they meet the requirements.

This offer is aimed at both new and existing customers:
New customers will have 60 days from when they become customers to get the €30, while existing customers only have this week (until January 31, 2021) to get the bonuses.
The €30 is obtained in the following way:
Orange Bank deposits you immediately into your account every time you perform any of the above actions.
It is the only account that is remunerated at 1% APR (the most profitable) and for an indefinite period currently on the market:
The Orange Bank account is exclusively for customers with an Orange mobile line (prepaid or contract).


We already saw that N26 or Celetem could be good replacements for Orange Bank which will close its doors on June 17, 2024. Today we want to analyze the B100 offer.
Unfortunately, we will lose the Orange Bank account which was very good for all the services it offered and there is no offer that gives everything.
In the case of B100, we miss immediate transfers, which are at a cost, and cash withdrawals at any ATM.
We must assume that Orange Bank will no longer exist and we must decide to go to another entity.
The alternatives that we have proposed, none are as good as Orange Bank (see here), perhaps N26 is one of the best offers (see here). But what about Cetelem?
Orange Bank will close all accounts on June 17, 2024, and there will be no migration of its customers to Cetelem, the entity that has purchased Orange Bank's business.
The only consideration that Cetelem has for Orange Bank customers is to give them a welcome offer, but they need to register with Cetelem."

Specifically, it concerns non-compliance with regard to the delivery of pre-contractual information (especially in cases of novations), as well as its content (omission of formalization expenses and other mandatory costs) and the contractual documentation. (omission of the APR), as well as with regard to the calculation of the APR.
In this way, Cajamar, which to date had not been sanctioned for this reason, is added to the long list of banks fined, being the third with the lowest fines in history for these reasons.
Curiously, ING, the bank that we all assume to be the most transparent bank, has been the bank with the highest fine. He committed 2 errors, 3 million for deficiency in the APR calculation and 2.4 million for not controlling the agencies that gave these offers with misinformation.
If we add the sanctions from Popular to those from Banco Santander (5.7 million), to which it belonged already in 2018 and in fact imposed on Santander, it would be the ""winning"" bank.
We thought we would keep it separate, because the infraction was committed in Popular, even though Santander had to assume it.
Another similar and related infraction that banks have committed and that have been sanctioned appears to be non-compliance with Laws 41/2007, 2/1994 and 44/2002.

This is precisely what has happened in recent months with offers from Banco Sabadell, BBVA, Santander, Bankia, CaixaBank and even ING.
Consumption, understands that in order to change the conditions, it is necessary to meet 3 requirements:
Consumption establishes that if the above is not met, the client can cancel the contract immediately and without penalties.
In all cases, to a greater or lesser extent, the recent changes by the different banks have fulfilled this.
According to the government website, ""if there is a contractual modification contrary to the commercial offer without expenses or zero commissions, the client can demand compliance with the full content of the offer and the entity cannot demand new conditions to continue enjoying a costs without maintenance costs.

It is the same offer that Bankinter has (see here), but it falls behind in terms of the profitability of the account. Bankinter offers up to €350 in interest over 2 years for €5,000.
They are not the only banks that want to capture payroll, in the market there are offers of up to €480 (see best offers here) to try to seduce you into taking your payroll to their bank.
Logically, all these offers are to give you an account without commissions, unlike banks like Santander, BBVA, Banco Sabadell, CaixaBank or Bankia, which even taking your payroll is not enough to avoid paying commissions (up to €240 commission), you have to link more (see here).
As we have said, ING offers €50 to both the godfather and the godson who keeps a payroll (€100 is spent) in addition to offering all services for free.
To qualify for this promotion, the godson must meet the following 2 points:
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus. The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
As for the godfather. Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, so they can get a total of 500 euros.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.

Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants or will pay commissions.


ING now asks, in addition to direct debiting a payroll, to spend money with your debit card if you want to receive up to €120 welcome.
Before they gave you the bonus directly if you direct deposited your income in the bank, now, in addition, you must spend money in a series of supermarkets that they indicate to receive those €120
ING tells you to make your “savings work for you with the new 3-month APR 2.50% Deposit” as “more than 250,000 customers” have already done.
But ING knows that whatever it launches, it works. As the bank says, more than 250,000 clients have hired it, although it does not specify how long or for what amount.
Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.

The catch is that it is a foreign bank, because for all intents and purposes NN Bank is a Dutch entity:
That is its weak point because it generates extra tasks for savers. However, you will not have extra tasks (except including interest in your income tax return) if you do not have more than €50,000 abroad.


NN Bank or NN Spain will close the Savings Account of all its clients next week. An account that at a time of negative rates was a worthy successor to ING, has disappeared with the rate increase and will soon come to nothing.

The online opening of the MyInvestor Junior account is 100% online and admits a single owner – the minor – and one or two legal representatives.
Once a client, the minor could invest in the entity's range of funds (Plus Funds, index funds, Strategic Funds) and discretionary management index funds (Classical, Pop, Indie, Rock and Heavy Metal).

If you intend to attract customers with this campaign, I'm afraid they don't count on our users. And the funniest thing is that it limits the offer to 120,000 customers (will there be that many dupes?)
At first we are already afraid of the conditions of Santander One (payment of up to €240 commission, see here), but the Santander One Iberia Plus Plan charges additional commissions.
Offers in exchange for signing up for a Santander One Iberia Plus Plan and depending on the amount of the payroll:
The offer, which will last until March 31, 2021, represents an increase in the initial welcome bonus to the general plan which has 3 levels:
It is the only free one, the plan itself, because there are commissions for the account (unless you hyper-link) and for the credit card (Minimum €3 per month), mandatory.
It gives you 1,000 welcome Avios and then, for example, a Santander One commission-free customer will get another 50 monthly and 1 for every 5 euros they pay with the credit card.
This would be the interesting plan to take with the promotion of direct debiting the payroll (10,000 or 15,000 Avios instead of 1,000)
It makes you pay another monthly commission of €4, in addition to the account and the card, of course.
In exchange, you get 9,000 welcome Avios and another 500 per month and 1 for every 3 euros paid with the credit card.
This is where you get the 15,000 Avios. It also gives you another 500 monthly and 1 for every 2 euros paid with the credit card.
But in exchange for a fortune: €4 monthly commission for the Plan and €100 annual commission for the Santander Iberia ICON card, and don't forget about the account.

That's a great question, and there's no answer, because it depends on Iberia's flight deals.
Iberia only sets what each Avios is worth in miles traveled: 1 mile, between 0.25 and 1 Avio in economy class.
Searching more intensely on the Internet, in pointsviajeros it sets its value at around €0.01; and the best offer achieved in your life, €0.04.
So, the 10,000 Avios or 15,000 Avios free welcome in exchange for salary are about €100 or €150? which could be interesting.
But is it that you have a difficult time recovering the €3 card fee each month?

Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.

Some wanting to charge us and others forcing us to put it in...
In 2012, a PP government limited the cash payment to €2,500 when one of the parties involved was a company or professional.
The current government (PSOE + Podemos) is processing a law to reduce this limit to 1,000 euros, but in principle only for operations between professionals.
However, in recent days it has been considering limiting all payments involving a professional or company to €1,000 (payments from individuals to companies as well).
The limit on operations for individuals with tax domicile outside of Spain will also be lowered, from 15,000 to 10,000 euros.
Only payments between individuals or between individuals and financial institutions will continue without limits.
There is no scheduled date yet, but it will be in a few months. The new draft anti-fraud law is being processed, which includes this prohibition and/or limitation.
The sanction will consist of a fine of 25% of the amount paid in cash. Both the payer and the person receiving the payment are jointly and severally liable for the infringement.
The party who reports the transaction within 3 months from the date of payment is exonerated from liability.
The simultaneous presentation of a complaint by both parties will not exonerate any of them from liability.
The government deals another blow to consumers by prohibiting them from paying in cash for purchases of more than €1,000.
When it comes into force, you will no longer be able to buy an appliance that costs more than €1,000 in cash and you will have to do so via some electronic means."
996,I still don't receive child benefit and I received it in June. Has it been taken away from me?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/sigo-sin-cobrar-la-prestacion-por-hijo-a-cargo-y-lo-cobre-en-junio-me-lo-han-quitado/,20/01/2021,"Social Security made the payment of the dependent child benefit (points) between January 16 and 18, 2021 when the official date fell on Saturday.
The vast majority of people have already collected it, but others still do not have the money in their accounts when they have always collected it on time. Have you lost your right to help? Why are they still not getting paid?
The law does not say that you have to pay on the 16th. If you have done so, it is out of habit. This year it fell on the 16th on a Saturday and most of them received it on the 18th.
Article 18 of Royal Decree 1335/200 says that ""The payment of the economic allowance... will be semi-annual and must be made each semester expired, except in the financial allowances for disabled dependent children over 18 years of age, for which the payment will be monthly, and will be made per monthly payment due.
In fact, people who are called to Social Security and get assistance, the official is informing them that they can pay until the 30th.
The IMV (Minimum Vital Income) replaces the help of points. If you are entitled to the IMV, you are not entitled to the points.
Whether you have requested it or if they have processed it for you ex officio (they do it directly for all the beneficiaries of the points), you continue collecting the points, as long as they do not grant it to you.
It is possible that they have granted it to you and they have not yet made your first payment (it will be from June 2020).
If the IMV has denied you, they have to pay you the points. But it is possible that due to the current saturation of Social Security they made a mistake or left your file in the pending pile, etc. etc. Call Social Security to claim your help.
Your points aid cannot be extinguished due to the denial of the IMV according to the seventh transitional provision of Royal Decree-Law 20/2020. The denial and request for the IMV is not a reason for termination of the dependent child benefit.

Many of you indicate that you collected the points on June 26, the first half of the 2020 aid, but not now.
There are different reasons to terminate aid, is this your case?
1. You have been granted the IMV
As we have said, if they grant you the IMV, they take away your points. It is good news, because the IMV is a higher amount and is also paid monthly.
In fact, if they do not pay you the points for the IMV, you will collect the IMV from June 2020. You will receive the payment for 7 months of 2020 (it will be a lot of money).
2. You have been denied the IMV
It is possible that your IMV has been suspended (Never extinguished) and your points have not been reactivated. Call and complain. You have the right to continue collecting points.
3. Economic reasons
If you were eligible then, your aid cannot be terminated in the second half of the year for economic reasons.
The law (article 17 of the aforementioned RD) says that ""the termination or modification is motivated by the variation of the computable annual income, this will take effect on January 1 of the year following the year to which said income corresponds."" So if you collected in June, you have to collect now (unless you have been granted the IMV).
4. The annual income statement
The annual income statement (DAI) must be submitted annually in the first quarter of the year.
If you did not submit said declaration, your aid would have been terminated as of January 1, 2020 and you would not have been paid for the first semester.
But the problem may arise from the DAI. In that declaration you must enter the correct information and they will verify it later when you file your income tax return.
In the case of not submitting the income tax return, only being obliged to do so, they take away your aid as of July 1, that is, you do not have the right to collect now.
Problems may also arise when verifying the data.
4. Respond to a notification from Social Security
If Social Security has detected any inconsistency in the DAI, it will surely have sent you a request to correct or explain.
Logically, those who have attended to this request will know how their situation has turned out.
But there are people, for whatever reasons, have not heeded said notification. It is a reason for suspension of aid and now it is your turn to claim.
Make an appointment at Social Security (it is usually saturated), and request information and/or make a claim.
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more."
997,How to use Bizum with Orange Bank? Registration process in the Orange APP,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/como-usar-bizum-con-orange-bank/,19/01/2021,"Orange Bank has integrated Bizum into its APP. You don't need to install anything else, only with the Orange Bank APP you can create a Bizum.
With this, it allows you from the Orange Ban APP itself to send and receive money immediately from mobile to mobile without needing to know the bank account numbers, just with the mobile number.

You will have to configure Bizum to work with Orange Bank.
Also, if you used Bizum with another bank, it will tell you that Bizum can only be used with a single bank, so it will deactivate your previous configuration.

You must confirm reading the conditions (>> See Bizum conditions)

Now every time you access Bizum, you will directly enter Bizum to carry out operations.

Openbank does have the immediate transfer service, the bad thing is that the bank charges you a €4 commission (€2 if it is from the payroll account). However, you can use Bizum and it will be free.
We tell you how to do it.
If your bank does not offer you immediate transfers or charges you for them, you can use Bizum to do so.
We tell you how to do it and its limitations.
A couple of weeks ago we told you that both Unicaja and Orange Bank had lowered the limit of operations per month that will allow their Bizum clients from 150 to 60.
Today we confirm that it is Bizum that will lower this limit and will affect all banks."
998,"Orange Bank, path to excellence: 1% APR, free, free and now also with Bizum",https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/orange-bank-camino-hacia-la-excelencia-1-tae-gratis-gratis-y-ahora-tambien-con-bizum/,19/01/2021,"At the time we criticized Orange Bank because it was a 100% mobile entity, but it did not have Bizum, the system to send and receive money immediately from mobile to mobile without needing to know bank account numbers. (see here).
Well, from now on, your APP now allows you to create a Bizum. It's what you have to do to achieve excellence.
This new functionality joins its existing advantages: free immediate transfers, all ATMs free to withdraw cash (3 times a month) and on top of that it rewards up to €20,000 at 1% APR. What more could you want?
Okay, yes. We can think of ONLY ONE THING, and that is for that 1% APR to last for a long time, but we have a feeling that any day we have to give you bad news.
…since we are talking, we would also ask that it is not necessary to be an Orange customer to register, although the bank has already said that it will be possible at the end of 2021.
The account offers a Spanish IBAN but under the French FGD and has a limited maximum amount to be paid:
It is also giving a €30 bonus to new customers who link their card with a payment application and use it (see here).
Orange Bank allows you to send money immediately through free immediate transfers for a maximum of €15,000 per operation.
The only difference with respect to Bizum is that it requires knowing the recipient's account number.
The entity allows you to withdraw cash from any ATM in the EU without commissions. Of course, it is limited to 3 operations per month, which we believe is enough.
It is necessary to be an Orange customer to register with OrangeBank, which is of little concern because there is a free way (see here).
The bank confirmed that there are no problems (see here)

The payroll will not be enough,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/unicaja-sube-comisiones-para-clientes-menos-vinculados-hasta-120e-la-nomina-no-sera-suficiente/,19/01/2021,"Unicaja is informing its clients that starting March 15, 2021, new conditions or new commissions will be applied to their accounts.
Specifically, it will charge a flat rate of €10 per month, €120 per year in commission (previously €84) to clients less linked to their accounts.
It will be the third entity, along with Santander and Sabadell, that does not use payroll + receipts + use of cards (see here).
To be exempt from commissions, request an investment fund and/or pension plan and/or insurance.

3. No commissions (zero commission plan).

It will also increase card fees if you are not in the Zero Fee Plan.
>> See zero commission plan
It is difficult for many savers to have the investment products that Unicaja requires to be exempt from commissions.
The most sensible decision will be to leave, and there are alternatives:



Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are, but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost.
But we tell you how to stay in the bank.
As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.
We tell you a way to get rid of commissions in these cases."

Currently the MyInvestor account and OrangeBank had many things in common and with some differences (see comparison here), but with the change it will be like night and day, being comparable only during the initial period of high profitability.
The MyInvestor account will look like this:
1. New clients: If you become clients now, it gives you 1% APR for 12 months.
2. Already clients:
The characteristics of the account will be:
The offer is exclusively for new customers of the bank, including current AndBank customers.

*NNBank will lower your account to 0.3% APR starting January 21
*Wizink continues to offer its former clients 0.5% APR on their savings account indefinitely.
It is the most profitable thing that can be achieved now in a savings account, the bad thing is that it can only be contracted by customers with an Orange mobile line (at the end of 2021 it will no longer be necessary), although it is not a big problem either, you can become a customer of prepaid (we have done it and it has involved no cost).
Furthermore, once you register, you do not have to continue being an Orange customer. You can throw away the orange card.

It will offer a high-yield savings account and deposit under the French FGD:
Under the Spanish FGD. This is the online branch of Banco Pichincha, offering 0.2 percentage points more than its physical banking. Be careful, that can change:
It also has deposits of up to 0.8% APR. Furthermore, if you open the payroll account you would have all the services.
With Spanish FGD, Wizink offers 0.5% APR on accounts opened before August 1, 2020:

This account is under the Dutch FGD:
This is the only account with a foreign IBAN. The money is in Holland and is not subject to withholding. The client must declare the interest in the income tax return.
Furthermore, since the money is abroad, if you have more than €50,000 outside of Spain you have to complete form 720 annually.
Since July, EBN offers its account at 0.3% APR under the Spanish FGD.
It usually has high-profit deposits, but its marketing is now suspended.
It is the same as Pibank, but with offices and lower profitability.


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"

Depending on the current relationships you have with the bank, you may have to pay more or bond more.
The bank defines 4 types of relationships/customer profiles for Santander One.
1. Income and payment links:
2. Product Links
3. Shareholders (1,000 bank shares)
4. Select Clients or private banking.
Depending on your links, you will have to pay more or less:

This would be the most sensible decision. Leave a bank that has offered a lot (well used), but now will charge you double.
There are many alternatives:
The first thing you have to collect is the information of all the receipts that you have direct deposited in the Santander account to move it to another bank.
To change, there are 2 alternatives:
You can leave any bank by porting in the style of telephone companies.
You go to the recipient bank where you want to take the things, you fill out a form with everything and it will take care of everything. You don't have to do anything else, you don't even have to set foot in a Santander office.
The danger is that you will not be able to protest if Santander charges you any commission (in the process). It will come in the liquidation.
Furthermore, it is possible that during the process a problem arises (stocks, credit cards) and the account is not closed correctly or on time, so you will be charged a commission starting next Monday.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
The Banco Santander promotion in which they give away €400 in cash, direct debit of a payroll and 2 receipts, will last for 2 more weeks.
If you are interested in this offer, you have until the 5th of opening to take advantage of the offer, however, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month.
But if you don't have that much salary, you can get €300, as long as you earn at least €600 a month.
Banco Santander continues until April 2024 with its offer of €400 in bonus cash for bringing a payroll and 2 receipts to the bank.
Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
1002,Scared by the record prices of LIGHT? with PVPC it is still cheaper,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/asustado-por-los-precios-record-de-la-luz-con-el-pvpc-sigue-siendo-mas-barato/,18/01/2021,"If you have read the press in the last week, you will have seen some headlines such as ""electricity bill at maximum"" or ""most expensive electricity bill in history"" among others.
Well, this ""disproportionate"" increase in electricity is due to climatic effects (there was already such a spike in 2018), and UNFORTUNATELY, it does not affect everyone, but does not reach 50% of homes.
Yes, it is like that, because it only affects households that have contracted the PVPC (voluntary small consumer price), the one regulated by the government.
Those of you who do not have this bill do not have to worry about this spike; But you do have to worry because of this lack of concern (you will understand this by reading the next point).
Yes, despite this beastly rebound, the PVPC will continue to be cheaper than the free rate for most cases, even with this beastly rebound; Imagine what you can save the rest of the time.
In this sense, Curenergía, the marketer of Iberdrola's PVPC, is sending communications to its clients to reassure them and remind them that ""the PVPC with a social bonus continues to be the most appropriate option.""
He adds that due to this increase in costs, it will affect his bill ""approximately €5.2 compared to what it would be with December prices.""
Most of those who are in the free market pay €10 to €20 or even €30 more every month.
The document that we have had access to is a family with a Social Bonus (with a discount for being a vulnerable family).
Taking into account that the Social Bonus offers a maximum bonus of 40%, the increase for the month of December/January will not reach €10.
But as we have said, these paid at least €10 more, so at most, this month those in the PVPC will pay the same as those in the free market.
Let's imagine an invoice from December 16 to January 15 (1 month), with a power of 3.45Kw and a consumption of 200Kwh. The cost would be:
If consumption were 250Kwh:
* According to OCU, practically all homes consume at least 50% of the energy during off-peak hours. If it were more, the more you save. So for most cases time discrimination is appropriate.
Tell me who pays less... If you have any questions, read our previous article on the matter: both the PVPC and time discrimination (see here).
There we give you the reasons why the PVPC is cheaper, especially as you can see, with time discrimination.
Also, if you want, leave us your details (in comments below) of your invoice: cost, billing period, power and consumption and we will tell you what it would have cost you with the PVPC and your savings.
The new 2.0TD electricity rate will come into effect next Tuesday, June 1, which will be more expensive and will have time discrimination.
The PVPC is the cheapest rate in most cases (up to €200 cheaper per year), with the change it will continue to be so, but you will have to pay something more.
It seemed strange to us that politicians were going to legislate for the benefit of consumers and taxpayers or the majority of them.
It would have been like this if they had maintained the prices and forced everyone to use the time-sensitive rate.
What it is really going to do is equalize everyone, making those who currently pay less pay more, the time discrimination thing.
In the month of April 2021, the new electricity rate (2.0 TD) will come into effect, which will have time discrimination for everyone and will benefit many people.
We tell you why, and what the new 2021 electricity rate will be like."

1004,Which banks have already paid the points or child benefit? when the rest?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/que-bancos-ya-ha-pagado-los-puntos-o-prestacion-por-hijo-cuando-el-resto/,17/01/2021,"The POINTS aid, or family aid for children or benefit for dependent children is collected on the 16th of July and January.
This year, due to COVID, the payment of some aid has been advanced, but they have forgotten about the aid for children.
Many beneficiaries of this aid expected that their payment would be brought forward to the month of December and thus be able to give their little ones a somewhat more decent Christmas, but that was not the case.
In fact, they haven't even collected many yet, because unfortunately January 16, 2021 fell on a Saturday.
There have been many users who have asked us when will they get paid? and many other users (from almost all banks) have been informing us if they have charged it or not.
We summarize it for you:
2 banks came forward on the scheduled date to make the payment.
Sabadell was the first bank to start paying, even before the 16th. It was on the 15th at noon (see here).
It was followed by Banco Santander, which also did so on the 15th, but in the afternoon (see here).
On the 16th, several rural savings banks and Openbank paid:
There is contradictory information about Ibercaja (see here), there are people who still do not get paid. We don't know if they don't have the right, if there is an incident.
The worst was the disappointments. ING and Unicaja informed clients that they would be paid on the 16th, but in the end this was not the case.
ING informed its clients, who called to inquire, that they would be paid that day (see here). But at midday the bank was no longer so sure (see here). From what some say, it is because Social Security has not sent the payments (see here). Is rare.
There were also some users who trusted Unicaja (see here) and said that they always paid around 6:00 p.m. even if it was Saturday or Sunday. But it was not like that. Similar problem as with ING?
On the 18th, they will collect the rest. It is the first business day after the 16th.
NOTE, keep in mind that saying the 18th does not mean that the 18th at 00:00 will be in your accounts. It is throughout the 18th.
Since the entry into force of the Minimum Vital Income (IMV), you can NO longer request aid from points, the aid was integrated into the IMV.
The downside is that NOT all those who could benefit from the help of POINTS are entitled to the IMV due to the issue of HERITAGE. In this way, future parents stay without this help and will not charge the IMV either.
The current beneficiaries will continue to receive payment indefinitely as long as they continue to meet the requirements (Seventh transitional provision of Royal Decree-Law 20/2020).

If you are beneficiaries of the points aid, Social Security (SS) has ex officio analyzed or is analyzing your situation to see if they grant you the IMV. If you have the right, they will notify you and if not, then nothing. You remain the same and without news from the SS.
However, many have requested it anyway, fearing that the SS do not have enough data, and have been denied help.
The fact that you are denied the IMV does not mean that you lose family support for children. If for any reason you do not collect it on Monday, January 18, 2021, make an appointment at Social Security. They have to fix your situation.
If you are granted the IMV, you automatically stop collecting points.
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).

The good thing, or the least bad thing, is that it is not applied immediately, but rather it guarantees that all clients receive that 1% APR for at least 1 year:
1. New clients: If you become clients now, it gives you 1% APR for 12 months.
2. Already clients:
With this change, its offer becomes something similar to what Openbank gives (acquisition promotion) and is far from Orange Bank, which continues to give a 1% APR for an indefinite period of time (how long will it last?).
With this reduction the bank (it is justified in its statement to its clients) can guarantee that until 2025 it will not charge you commissions.
The entity has not touched the maximum limit to be remunerated, which will continue to be €15,000. In this way, clients will receive a maximum of just over €10 per month in net interest.

The offer is exclusively for new customers of the bank, including current AndBank customers.

Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
MyInvestor extended the marketing period until April 30, 2024, its deposits have 3, 6 and 12 month terms unchanged and continue at 3% APR.
This interest rate was set on February 22, and was initially scheduled to last until March 27, but has been extended for 1 more month.
MyInvestor deposits at 3% APR have a marketing expiration date set for next Wednesday, March 27, 2024.
The current offer is from February 22, 2024, when the bank set its 3 fixed terms at 3, 6 and 12 months at 3% APR.
They are interesting offers, but when trying to capture the same customer niche as Banco Big (3.5% APR) or Cuenta Facto (3.8% APR), we believe it falls behind; but it's always good to have another alternative"

Families with lower income according to the following table (2021):

The income of both spouses is taken into account for the income limit.
Both spouses can apply, and they must agree. In the absence of agreement, aid is granted to the mother.

But there are exceptions, such as public officials and employees who will have an alternative within the bank.
This is a special offer from Banco Santander aimed at public officials and employees.
Public workers will have at their disposal the “Collective Current Account” with all free services:
The change is not automatic, you have to request it and the offer is valid until February 2021 and as always, the bank has the power to modify the conditions with prior notice to its customers.
You just have to prove your membership in this group. There is no need to domiciliate payroll, or anything at all (due to the information provided on their website).
For this accreditation, it is useful:
Yes, young people, children and people without resources. Your accounts, the “Smart Account”, the “Mini Account” and the “Basic Account” (respectively) will remain valid and commission-free.

Those from Account 123 will be transferred on January 18, and those from Account Zero 123, on February 15, 2021.

The danger is that you will not be able to protest if Santander charges you any commission (in the process). It will come in the liquidation.

1008,Is BBVA the first bank to charge a commission for deposits? ING? Others?,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/es-bbva-el-primer-banco-que-cobra-comision-por-los-depositos-ing-comparativa-comisiones-depositos/,14/01/2021,"If you take a look at the digital press or do a search on the internet you will see this headline in almost all the media: BBVA, the first bank to charge for deposits, with one nuance or another.
Is BBVA really the first bank to charge for deposits? The answer is yes, but as we say, two qualifications:
1. It is the first bank to charge individuals for deposits. There were already banks that charged companies and large holders of cash.
2. It has NOT been the first bank to have made the decision to charge for deposits. ING did it in the month of November (the 11th), but will not begin charging until April 1, 2021.
Therefore, the one who opened the ban on charging commissions for deposits was not BBVA, curiously it was the ""commission-free bank"", ING.
Both BBVA and ING exempt their clients from paying commissions on deposits if they are linked to the bank (BBVA requires more than ING).
In addition, commissions are applied from a certain amount of money (ING penalizes lower amounts).
On the other hand, ING applies a flat rate of €10 per month, while BBVA applies a percentage on the excess of the commission-free limit (€100,000).
BBVA's decision will practically not affect anyone, at least our users. None of our users will have more than €100,000, guaranteed by the FGD, in the same bank.
Furthermore, anyone who has €150,000 in BBVA can and wants to pay €12.50 commission per month, €150 per year (-0.1% TIN).
On the other hand, ING may affect our readers more (€30,000 is not an exaggerated amount). In any case, according to official ING data there were only about 170,000 clients in the month of November, 4% of its total clients.
Surely today, there will be many fewer and on April 1, we believe that absolutely NO ONE and therefore, no one will pay commission at ING.
As you can see, the commissions you may charge will be small and easy to avoid.
The important thing is the fact of charging commissions for ""keeping the money"", and once the line is crossed, then we will have to worry about ""how much"", which will go ""in crescendo""
In fact, it is not correct to say that ""the bank keeps our money."" It is not a safe. What we do is lend them our money, because they take that money and invest it or lend it or do whatever they want (almost, because it is supervised by the BdE).
Hence we worry about the issue of the FGD and the solvency of the bank.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
BBVA Italia has lowered the profitability of its Flexible Deposit from 4.25% APR to 3% APR, but increases the term from 12 to 24 months. On the other hand, you keep your account at 4% APR.
Despite this drop, we would like BBVA Spain to offer them to us here, but the bank does not even allow us to contract them on the BBVA Italy website if we do NOT have nationality and residence in Italy: it requires, Italian telephone number, NIF Italian, etc.
The BBVA promotion, which launched in January, in which it pays you all your bills domiciled in the entity for 1 year with a maximum of €60 per month (€720 per year), will end on March 31, 2024 .
You still have a little more than 2 weeks to take advantage of this offer aimed at new customers who open an online account without commissions."
1009,Bankinter friend plan: €50+€50 and 5% APR in exchange for payroll… and others charging you commissions,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/plan-amigo-bankinter-50e-50e-y-5-tae-a-cambio-de-nomina-y-otros-cobrandote-comisiones/,13/01/2021,"Bankinter also has the current friend plan like ING offering €50 to both the godfather and the godson in addition to remunerating your money at 5% APR during the first year and 2% APR during the second year.
It is the big difference that exists between this bank and others such as Banco Santander, BBVA, Banco Sabadell, CaixaBank or Bankia that having your payroll directly debited is not enough to have a commission-free account, and they force you to connect more.
These entities charge up to €240 in commission even with direct debit payroll (see here).
Yesterday we told you that ING spent €100 to collect your payroll (see here), because Bankinter, in addition to those €100, gives you another €350 in interest for 2 years for only €5,000 that you deposit in the bank.
Bankinter has the friend plan in effect until January 29, 2021 applicable to the contracting of a Payroll Account (from €800 in payroll) or Bk Payroll (young people, from €500 in payroll).
The process is simple, when signing up for the account, the new client must enter a promotional code from the friend with an active Payroll Account and both benefit from a bonus of €50 gross for each one.
NOTE: If you don't have a friend with an account, you can request a sponsor in the comments below.
The new client must direct the payroll within 3 months of contracting and maintain the account for 12 months (permanence).
The client can only be a sponsor for a maximum of 5 new clients. Payment is made from the day after account activation.
The promotion is limited to the first 1,000 new customers and until January 29, 2021.
NOTE, from what they are telling us, both the godfather and the godson have to be under 35 years of age, even if it does not appear in the promotion rules.
>> See promotion bases
Until June 30, 2021, Bankinter offers its offer to remunerate you at 5% APR during the first year, and a second year at 2% APR for the money you deposit in the Payroll Account.
But it has a little trick, and that is that this profitability is not for all the money you want, it only pays the first €5,000 (young Bk, only €3,000).
A client could get at most:
It is a good offer considering that it is the same (even improved in terms of requirements) as what was offered at least 9 years ago (We published it for the first time in 2012). And since then the landscape of accounts and deposits has changed radically.
The requirements to obtain these interests are in the case of the Payroll account:
If you do not have a payroll, you can also benefit from this offer by fulfilling the following obligations:
Be careful, this offer is also aimed at existing Bankinter customers, but if it meets the following 2 points:
The total bonus for both promotions would be €400 gross (€260 in the case of Bk Young) or €324 net (after paying taxes) for the new customer. The bank spends €450 for each payroll.
Be careful, only the Payroll Account is worth it. If you do not have a payroll, you will only be able to get €350 in interest.
It is a good offer and a good alternative to attract those dissatisfied with the latest changes at BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank, Bankia or even Banco Sabadell.
The characteristics of payroll and non-payroll accounts are:
This offer will be available until June 30, 2021. Offer valid until 40,000 new accounts are contracted.


Anyone who has not had an Orange Bank account does not know what we are going to lose. The entity will close in 2024 and the clients will be transferred to Cetelem.
Today we have tried to look for an alternative, and we have not found any offer that equals or surpasses Orange Bank: either ATMs fail, or some operation is not available or with a cost, or it requires payroll or income.
Bankinter has launched its Business Plan Account 0, through which the bank offers its small and medium-sized business (SME) clients a remuneration of 3% APR during the first year and 1.5% APR the second year, with a maximum balance on which to remunerate 50,000 euros and without commissions.
Bankinter increases the profitability of its Digital Current Account up to 1.5% APR for new customers as long as you put more than €50,000 in the account.
Otherwise, the profitability will be lower."
1010,Do you have “0” accounts at AndBank/Inversis? Don't become MyInvestor: Commissions!!,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/tienes-cuentas-a-0-en-andbank-inversis-no-te-hagas-de-myinvestor-comisiones/,12/01/2021,"Users and clients of the former entity, Inversis, which was acquired by AndBank, are reporting to us that when opening the MyInvestor Account they are being charged commissions retroactively from previous years (since 2016).
The issue is not trivial, because the charge is more than €150 plus interest (about €20 per semester?).
If you have one of these accounts at AndBank, close it as soon as possible, especially if you are thinking of opening an account at MyInvestor.
Years ago, there were people who hired a securities account and a cash account to manage an Inversis investment fund.
In 2015, AndBank acquired Inversis and many people stopped working with the entity. But since those accounts had no commissions, they left it open and without a balance.
These same clients, attracted by the 1% APR account of MyInvestor (from AndBank), have become clients and have deposited their money so that it becomes profitable.
AndBank, upon finding a balance, has charged you for all the commissions from recent years.
Some clients have contacted the bank and been told that if they close those accounts, the entity will return the commissions charged.
The entity has written to us stating that: “MyInvestor clients are not being charged any commission derived from Andbank accounts, even if the same client has accounts in both firms. We understand that clients who have reported this incident have misunderstood some other type of charge or it corresponds to some type of specific incident. The conditions of MyInvestor and Andbank are different, as are their product and service offerings.”
The person who contacted us has also offered to resolve the ""misunderstanding"" personally. So if anyone wants to contact him (leave us a comment below), we will make it easier for you.
You have to send a letter with your information: name, surname, photocopy of your ID, and sign a document requesting the closure of the account and the return of commissions.
This letter (most conveniently, certified with acknowledgment of receipt) must be sent to the attention of the Administration department at Calle Serrano 37 28001 Madrid.
Many believe that if an account is at 0, the bank does not charge you a commission; In some cases yes, but not in AndBank for a few weeks.
The entity sent some communications to its clients that I leave below.

These commissions charged are contrary to article 3 of Ministerial Order EHA/2899/2011, of October 28, 2011.
It would also comply with the criteria of good banking practices of the Bank of Spain, which considers that accounts that ""are maintained by imposition of the entity and are used exclusively to pay interest on a deposit, or to service a mortgage or personal loan , or payments derived from any other type of operation, it would not be up to clients to bear any maintenance and/or administration commission.


In various digital media you can find news about the launch of a deposit at 5% APR from MyAndBank, the digital channel of AndBank, from the same group as MyInvestor.
Accounts with ""high"" profitability and no commissions are not extinct. There are and some even more profitable than most deposits.
There are up to 8 accounts on the market that remunerate your money quite well in addition to not charging you any commission and without demanding anything in return.
We never believed that we were going to write the word commission together with ING or the Orange Account.
Of course, I had previously talked about commissions for the debit card or the non-payroll account in Germany if you stopped meeting their requirements.
But charging for the Orange Account, the iconic Orange Account that made ""your money grow day by day"", that ""if you needed your money you took it and the rest continued to grow at ING"" and an example of what it means to save (see image that can still be found online), is unheard of."

These entities charge up to €240 in commission even with direct debit payroll (see here).
On the other hand, ING spends €100 to capture each payroll, also offering all services for free.
It is not the best offer on the market, there are others that give up to €480 (see better offers here), but ING attracts many savers, especially with this offer.
This is your friend plan, in which you offer €50 to an ING client (sponsor) with a payroll account, who brings a friend (godson) to the entity and direct debits a payroll, with the friend also taking €50.
It is the same offer that Bankinter has (see here), but it falls behind in terms of the profitability of the account. Bankinter offers up to €350 in interest over 2 years for €5,000.
NOTE: If you don't have friends to be godfather, there are many people who offer. Leave a comment below.
The bank accepts any payroll, pension or unemployment benefit for the bonus.
To apply this offer it is as easy as when someone is going to open the account, indicate their friend's NIF in the commercial action code box and both will receive €50 when the first payroll is entered into ING Direct.
Taking into account that ING allows its clients to sponsor up to 10 people, they can get a total of 500 euros.
To qualify for this promotion, the godson must meet the following 2 points:
The godchild cannot have previously had a Payroll or Non-Payroll account with ING Direct.
Any PAYROLL Account client with active conditions and also those who have received the corresponding communication may be sponsors of this promotion.
Clients with active conditions will be considered those who have their payroll, pension or unemployment benefit domiciled in ING for the PAYROLL Account.
The incentive will be deposited into the Payroll Account of both the godson and the godfather once the promotion requirements are met.
>> More information.
Both accounts have the following notable advantages:
In the month of November, ING decided to charge its clients €120 commission unless you meet 1 of the following 2 conditions:
A stupid decision that tarnishes the name of the bank, because when we talk about ING we always talk about NO COMMISSIONS, but that is no longer the case.
Furthermore, it is a decision that only affects 171,000 clients, 4% of their total clients, who will logically withdraw the surplus and will not pay anything.
Nobody who is at ING wants to pay commissions.


Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are, but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost.
But we tell you how to stay in the bank.
As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.

Of course, the €400 is for payroll or large pensions, €2,500 per month, but it still gives you €300 if your payroll does not reach that amount, but does exceed €600 per month."
1013,Non-contributory pensions (PNC) for retirement and disability in 2021 are already €402.80 per month,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/las-pensiones-no-contributivas-de-jubilacion-e-invalidad-en-2021-ya-son-40280e-al-mes/,08/01/2021,"IMSERSO has already confirmed through its website the revaluation of Non-contributory pensions (PNC) up to €402.80 per month for this coming year (2021).
It represents an increase of 1.8%, about €7 more per month, or almost €100 per year.
This aid is intended for retirees and disabled people without the right to a contributory benefit. They will receive these €402.80 per month in 12 payments + 2 extras, with the total annual amount being €5,639.20.
The PNC is a monthly payment from the State for all people over 65 years of age, without the right to retirement or ordinary contributory pension for not having worked or contributed enough, and LACK of income.
This aid is also intended for people with disabilities equal to or greater than 65% and who also have no income.
Thus, there are 2 PNCs:
If you do not meet these profiles, there is other help (See here).
According to the IMSERSO website, in 2021 the PNC has increased by 1.80%, double that of the rest of the pensions, setting its amount at €5,638.09 per year, which is paid in 12 monthly payments plus two extraordinary payments per year.
The fee to be charged to each pensioner depends on their personal income and/or those of their economic unit, with the maximum and minimum amounts to be charged being the following:
When more than one non-contributory pension beneficiary lives within the same family, the individual amount for each of them is the following:
Those who have a degree of disability equal to or greater than 75%, as well as the need for another person to carry out the basic activities of daily life, may increase this individual amount of PNC with the so-called Supplement for Need, which corresponds to 50% of €5,638.09 per year, which for the year 2021 is €2,819.60 per year.
1. Retirement
In addition to the general requirements for non-contributory benefits, the citizen must meet the following conditions:
2. Disability
Cohabitation only with your spouse and/or second-degree blood relatives:
If among the blood relatives with whom he lives are any of his parents or children:
Yes. Retirement and disability benefits are incompatible with each other. If you collect disability benefits, when you reach retirement age it becomes retirement age.
Furthermore, these features are incompatible with:
The non-contributory retirement benefit is incompatible with:
There are more benefits (monthly salary, electricity, heating, child support, etc.) depending on your age and your economic and family situation (See here).
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more."
1014,"Banco Big's 1% APR deposit, currently not available in some Autonomous Communities",https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/el-deposito-al-1-tae-de-banco-big-de-momento-no-disponible-en-algunas-ccaa/,08/01/2021,"Banco Big launched its 1% APR deposit in Spain in October, but as of today it still cannot be contracted in certain Autonomous Communities (CCAA) and Autonomous Cities.
This is the case in Ceuta, the Canary Islands, Melilla, Navarra and the Basque Country. According to the bank, it is because they have to adapt to the fiscal particularities of these places without specifying a date.
It is a deposit that is of some interest, since it offers an excellent profitability (for what there is): 1% APR. This is a welcome deposit, the “Big Deposit” for new clients and rewards up to a maximum investment of €50,000.
The worst part of this product is its term, 3 months, a bit short of time with the following characteristics:
With this product a new client can get €125 gross interest during the 3 months if they deposit €50,000.
The entity currently offers 3 deposits:
It has the same characteristics as the welcome deposit, except that the maximum investment limit is €250,000.
Big offers the “Big Account”, a commission-free and remunerated account (Spanish IBAN) at 0.1% APR.
This account is in the style of the ING Orange Account:
Big is a Portuguese entity with a Portuguese bank account and a branch in Spain (Spanish IBAN and personal income tax withholdings in Spain). Therefore, it is covered by the Portuguese FGD: €100,000 per person and client.
Do you remember BES? The Banco Espirito Santo that offered super-profitable deposits a few years ago? Well, Big will work the same.
Regarding his solvency, there is not much data.
According to the latest audited data, the entity has a total of 2,277 million net assets, 347.1 million of its own capital and assets under supervision worth 3,401 million euros.
In 2018 they earned 23 million euros.


Banco BIG remodels its deposit offer with slight increases, and offers 2 deposits combined with investment funds of up to 5.06% APR.
In reality it is not an increase as such in normal deposits, it has simply adjusted the TIN and APR of the products.
This time it was necessary to lower the profitability of the deposits of the bank's clients, from a maximum of 3.5% APR to 3.25% APR.
The previous time, at the beginning of March, the bank lowered welcome deposits from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
Banco BIG has slightly lowered the profitability of its 6-month large welcome deposit from 4.25% APR to 4.1% APR.
It is a great offer, high profitability, allows early cancellations, it is a shame that it is only for 6 months and only for new customers."
1015,BBVA begins to charge commission for deposits like ING,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/bbva-comienza-a-cobrar-comision-por-los-depositos-al-igual-que-ing/,07/01/2021,"BBVA has decided to charge a commission to its individual clients for their deposits if they have no connection with the bank according to various digital media (elpais, elespañol, elperiodico...).
It sounds quite shocking, but it will not affect practically any saver on our website, since it will exclusively affect the balances of deposits that exceed €100,000 (2% of all BBVA customers).
And our users already know that you should never put more than €100,000 per person per bank, because that is the maximum amount of money guaranteed by the FGD (Deposit Guarantee Fund).
BBVA will charge 0.025% monthly for the balance that exceeds €100,000. That is, a negative interest rate of -0.3% APR.
This commission will be applied if the client has no connection with the bank: without a payroll or other products.
These clients are basically those who have an online account (commission-free and without ties). The other clients have to pay commissions (up to €100, see here) or are linked.
ING announced in November that starting in April it will begin charging €10 per month in commission to its unlinked clients (without a payroll account) who deposit more than €30,000 in the Orange Account.
This decision affects 171,000 clients of the entity, only 4% of its total clients.
So we believe that it has been a somewhat stupid decision, losing the image of Bank Without Commissions so that those 4% of clients withdraw the surplus of €30,000.
ING clients will never pay commissions, they first withdraw the money from the bank.
We believe that it is a strategy of getting used to the fact that deposits can be charged, and future decisions will affect a good handful of savers.


As you have read, Orange Bank, a branch in Spain, offers deposits of more than 3% APR through the Raisin platform, Dutch version, and for clients in the Netherlands.
We were shocked when one of our users sent it to us via email.
Openbank continues to invent nonsense, like the previous milonga of €60 per balance increase, which we criticized at the beginning of the month of December.
This time, the entity offers a deposit with a fairly normal profitability (0.75% APR), but as if to make it excellent or attract attention, it gives you €20 in an Amazon check, if the deposit is €10,000 or more.
Renault Bank is once again late paying the interest on its account and/or deposits from the settlement for the month of June. Something similar already happened in December.
In this sense, some users have contacted us asking about the problem."
1016,"Since 2021, the FGD must return your money in 10 days if your bank goes bankrupt",https://www.tucapital.es/bancos/fgd-fondo-de-garantia-de-depositos/el-fgd-desde-2021-ha-de-devolver-en-10-dias-tu-dinero-si-tu-banco-quiebra/,07/01/2021,"From January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2023, the FGD must return your money within a maximum period of 10 business days if your bank goes bankrupt.
Starting in 2024, the maximum period will be 7 business days as established in the Sixth Transitional Provision of Royal Decree 2606/1996, which was added in 2015.
A resounding, NO. Because the law itself contemplates the possibility of not being able to return the money within that period.
What it guarantees is that if the previous period has passed, and you have not been paid, it will give you, within a maximum period of 5 business days, after your request, an ""adequate amount of your guaranteed deposits in order to cover your support"", without specifying percentages, not anything at all.
Logically, the amount they give you will be deducted ""from the total refundable sum.""
There are 2 options:
We have already occurred examples of both cases and it depends on the size of the bank:
Before injecting any aid or liquidating the bank, a haircut will be applied that will affect the following order of priority, that is, the order of preference for applying haircuts to the different financial products in case of problems:
Deposits of less than 100,000 euros (guaranteed) are untouchable.
In the event of bankruptcy, the FGD will return up to €100,000 to the bank's clients without them having to ask for it and regardless of whether or not there are sufficient bank assets to cover them.
The funds are provided by the banks. According to the latest data we have, the FGD is at minimum levels.
The FGD currently has assets that barely exceed 2,000 million, four times less than pre-crisis levels, although greater than in the 2011 financial crisis, which was even negative.

For the final phase, after the 10-year transition, Ecofin has agreed to create a permanent firewall.
The agreement reached does not specify any specific formula, but it does leave the door open in a generic way for the fund to borrow in the markets if necessary.
The Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD) will remain at a minimum after the pending payments of the rescue of the CAM and the Catalan savings banks.
Is our money in danger? How does the FGD work?
The Italian economy is at risk due to several factors. To appease depositors, the banks intend to lend money to the FGD.
In this situation, is it safe to take out a deposit at Facto that now offers 1.2% APR for 6 months?
By now we believe that everyone knows that bank deposits are covered by the Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGD) of up to 100,000 euros per person and entity in the European Union.
This fund covers both the accounts and bank deposits of the participating entities.
But be careful, not all accounts and deposits are covered, nor are all entities attached to these funds."
1017,Arquia's corralito continues in 2021. It does not allow you to cancel the account and charges you a commission,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/el-corralito-de-arquia-sigue-en-2021-no-te-permite-cancelar-la-cuentas-y-te-cobra-comision/,05/01/2021,"2021 will be the third (calendar) year that Arquia commits the misdeed of not allowing its clients to freely close their accounts due to actions by the entity.
In 2020 there were already about 300 clients, and counting, who were unable to sell shares in the bank and therefore could not cancel their accounts.
Until 2019, there were no problems. But that year, the savings bank became a bank and began charging €50 in annual commissions, so many clients requested to cancel their accounts, but they cannot.
Arquia was a Cooperative Savings Bank, which required contributions of €200, which they returned when you wanted to leave, if you wanted to open an account.
But in 2019, the cooperative bank became a public limited company (Arquia Bank SA) and the former cooperative members became shareholders of the entity.
This fact was reported by ADICAE, since it was done without communication to the shareholders and without them knowing the conditions of the exchange, the number of shares and their price.
Thus, when you become a shareholder of the entity you have to have an account with them to be able to liquidate in the event of a sale (similar to Banco Santander), or in other words, before you can close the account you have to sell the shares.
Arquia Bank, unlike Banco Santander, is that its shares are not sold on the market.
Its sale depends on the conditions set by the bank's general meeting and that the actions must be requested, but as the months go by they are not executed.
In fact, about 300 clients have had the sales order for more than 1 year and only 54 have been executed, but new requests are arriving.
According to some affected people, they have created ""a group of affected people on Telegram that has almost 300 members.""
When it was a cooperative bank, its accounts had many advantages and were free of commissions.
But when it became Arquia Bank SA, they began to apply commissions:
And many thought that it was no longer worth it and wanted to leave but they couldn't.
There is no solution for selling shares. All that remains is to protest or report it to the Bank of Spain.
As for account commissions, they could be avoided: If you have an account exclusively for the collection or settlement of another product, you cannot be charged anything.
In this way, it is best to leave the account at 0, and not make any movements, nor make any charges and cancel the associated cards, checks, if you have them.
Also communicate this fact to your office when you give the sales order or if you have already given it, let them know now.
The bank denies the fact that it was mandatory to be a cooperative member to be a customer. Which is true, but they forced it if you wanted improved conditions on the accounts.
It also indicates that the accounts can be closed, but it requires a securities account, and we would be in the same (the commissions).
Another solution that the bank proposes is that you take the shares to a securities account at another entity. We do not advise it either. It costs you the transfer and then how are you going to sell it, if not it is sold on the market?


Arquia has reduced its 6-month deposit for new clients registered from January 1, 2024 by half a point, to 3.5% APR.
It has also modified the maximum investment limit, rising from €30,000 to €50,000. In this way, the final reward is greater, but at the expense of having to invest more money.
Arquia continues to offer its deposit for a 6-month term and at 4% APR for new clients and with the possibility of early cancellation during the month of October.
The characteristics of this deposit, called “Ven a Arquia deposit” are quite interesting. The bad thing requires connections.
Arquia offers a 6-month deposit and a 4% APR for new clients and with the possibility of early cancellation.
Anyone who reads that will say that those are 3 very interesting features for a fixed term currently. The problem is the BIG BUT."
1018,Wizink deposits at 0.8% APR also in 2021. No changes since August 2020,https://www.tucapital.es/depositos/depositos-wizink-al-08-tae-tambien-en-2021-sin-cambios-desde-agosto-de-2020/,05/01/2021,"Wizink maintains its deposits unchanged in January 2021, offering a maximum profitability of 0.8% APR.
This interest rate was set in the month of August with a substantial drop:
In the month of August, the entity also cut the profitability of its savings account from 0.5% APR to 0.1% APR.
The good thing is that accounts opened before August 1 continue at 0.5% APR indefinitely until further notice from the bank.
Wizink Deposits

The characteristics of its deposits are:
The current features of this account are:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
1019,It's not all bad news. IPREM and aid to the unemployed rise 5% in 2021. Timo?,https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/no-todo-son-malas-noticias-iprem-y-las-ayudas-a-los-parados-suben-un-5-timo/,05/01/2021,"The IPREM has been updated in 2021 with an increase of 5%, after 4 frozen years. Good news for the unemployed entitled to some subsidy from the Employment Service (SEPE) who will experience the same increase.
Specifically, this increase will mean €21 more per month in the pockets of the beneficiaries of the subsidies and the RAI that SEPE grants to the unemployed without the right to a contributory benefit.
But it also affects the unemployment rate: minimum and maximum amounts that are referenced to this index:
1. Amount of unemployment benefits and RAI:
2. Minimum amount of the benefit.
3. Maximum amount of the benefit.
The unemployment or unemployment benefit is not referenced to the IPREM, but rather to your contribution base for the last 3 months of work.
With the increase in the IPREM it does not affect you at all except in the following 2 situations:
In the January payroll, the days of aid for the month of December are charged, which continued with the 2020 IPREM.
When you will notice it, it will be in the payroll for the month of February, which is when you are charged for the days of the month of January already with the updated IPREM for 2021.
It was not because of the IPREM issue. It may be due to 3 reasons that we can think of now:
The Multiple Effects Public Income Indicator (IPREM) is the reference index used in Spain to calculate the income threshold for the purposes of aid, scholarships, unemployment benefits, free legal assistance, subsidies...
It was the substitute for SMI that before 2004 was used as a reference for this aid.
The IPREM is updated annually and is established in the General State Budget Law.
Since its birth, the IPREM has suffered a progressive upward change and around or below the CPI. But if we compare it with the SMI, it has clearly evolved below this index.
Both indices had the same value for 2004, but in 2020, the IPREM day is at €17.93 while the SMI is at €31.57. This has serious consequences for the unemployed.
In fact, this is the first year that the IPREM rises above the SMI.
Looking at the table, in the last 17 years, beneficiaries of unemployment benefits have lost 137 euros per month when their subsidy was referenced to the IPREM instead of the SMI.
The unemployed with the right to Unemployment Subsidy or Active Insertion Income (RAI) will receive €463 in January (payment is on February 10), €11 per month more than in 2021.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more.
The dependent child benefit, or commonly called ""points"", is paid by law on July 16 and January 16. However, this year, Openbank has brought forward this payment to December 27, almost 3 weeks in advance.
We do not know if it is because Social Security has decided to advance the payment (we do not believe it, because many people are indicating that they have not received it yet) or if it has been at the will of Openbank (probably).
If the general state budgets (LPGE) are approved without changes on this point in the Congress of Deputies, in 2022 the subsidized unemployed will earn 2.5%, about €11 per month more.
Unemployed people who are receiving the minimum contributory benefit will also receive more."

This time, Banco Pichincha has set the same deadline as its Online office, unlike on other occasions when it gave a much longer deadline.
The characteristics of the 12-month deposit:
A website user and Pichincha customer recently sent us a message indicating that the fees for early cancellation are different from those advertised on the website.
On the Pibank and Pichincia website it indicates that ""as a penalty for partial or total early cancellation, all interest received will be deducted.""
However, this client does not send a screenshot when he goes to contract the deposit that the cancellation fees are 0.9%.

If you are still a client of Banco Pichincha and not Pibank, we recommend that you switch to the latter. You have the same advantages, but with the Savings Account renting at 0.5% APR instead of 0.3% APR.
But you can easily make the change with a simple call to Pibank and it will transfer you to the online office and greater profitability.
We remind you that Pibank is simply an online office of Banco Pichincha, to all employees it is still Banco Pichincha.
These are the conditions of your paid account:


Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
Unlike Pibank, which has lowered the profitability of its 12-month deposit from 3.34% APR to 3.14% APR, Banco Pichincha maintains, at least for the moment, its 12-month deposit unchanged.
Banco Pichincha offers deposits similar to its online channel, Pibank, but at a lower profitability in the case of the 12-month deposit (3% APR) and the same profitability in the remunerated account (2% APR).
As we know, Pibank will lower rates in 2 days, and we can expect that these Pichincha products will do so in the same way, or maybe not?
Banco Pichincha has increased the profitability of both its Remunerated Account and your 12-month deposit. However, it is still far behind what its Pibank online branch offers.
The account now pays 1.51% APR and the 12-month deposit at 2.75% APR"

This is how the Treasury will reach into our pockets in 2021",https://www.tucapital.es/blogs/noticias/ano-nuevo-impuetos-nuevos-asi-metera-mano-hacienda-a-nuestros-bolsillos-en-2021/,04/01/2021,"I wish that with this first post of the year we could give you good news, but unfortunately, NO.
If in 2020 the banks looted us based on commissions, in 2021, it is the Treasury that will reach into our pockets based on up to 8 new taxes.
These increases affect all incomes, especially in the area of ​​VAT on some goods or services. The most affected, those who earn the most or those who have the most, via new sections in the savings and work income tax.
This year a new section is introduced in savings income. For interests over €200,000, the new bracket of 26% will be taxed.
A new section is added for incomes of more than €300,000 to which a 47% tax will be applied.
The tax on car, home or life policies will rise from 6% to 8%. If you have to renew any of these insurances, it will come with a raise.
Sugary and sweetened drinks will have to pay 21% VAT instead of 10% years ago.
Since the government made merchants charge for plastic bags, millions and millions of euros of profit have come out of consumers' pockets and into companies.
We can't believe that a plastic bag (because it is still used) costs €0.05, which most stores charge us.
Now, it will become even more expensive with the new tax on plastic products: €0.45 for each kilo of this material.
It is reduced from €8,000 to €2,000 tax-deductible. This will fundamentally affect the self-employed who use it as a savings tool for their future pension, which is usually the minimum (they contribute for the minimum).
It also affects the rest of the workers who want a means of savings to complement their future pension.
If you are going to buy a car and it is one of those affected, you will have to pay more taxes to receive the same.
These are vehicles with the following CO2 emissions per kilometer travelled:
Taxpayers with more than 10 million euros of assets will have to pay 3.5% instead of 2.5% of everything above that amount.
All of you who have had more than €50,000 as of December 31, 2023 have to present form 720 and you have until April 1 to do so.
If you do not present it or present it after the deadline, having the obligation, you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency.
One of the reasons why savers do not put money in foreign banks, which normally give more interest than Spanish banks or even foreign banks with a branch in Spain, is the fear of the 720 model.
In this article we will show you how to fill it out and you will see that it is as simple as filling out a form with information that we know.
Since last January 1, the deadline for submitting form 720, the declaration of assets abroad, was opened, if you have had money of a certain amount in foreign banks in 2023.
You have until April 1 to carry out this procedure or you will be exposed to fines from the Tax Agency."

But in 2020 we have also had 2 (almost 3) bank launches offering a 1% APR return on your money.
Is about:
The 3 banks have been put into operation in a period of just over 1 year and all 3 with the same intentions. Attract clients based on good profitability in their accounts and deposits and without commissions.
The 3 banks offer a 1% APR but in different ways:
OrangeBank directly offers that 1% APR in your savings account and, as we say, it is limited to €20,000.
The other 2 are given in deposits. Your savings accounts are less profitable:
Finally, Banco Big also offers other deposits with a return of up to 0.25% APR over 12 months (no big deal).
Seeing this, the weakest is Banco Big and OrangeBank and RenaultBank could be complemented.
Both give 1% APR, one (OrangeBank) with free money (but does not allow you to put in everything you want) and the other (RenaultBank) with blocked money (but without a money limit).
Both RenaultBank and Banco Big have limited services. This is a bank for savings, not for operating. It is the style of ING in its beginnings. Only savings account and deposits.
OrangeBank, on the other hand, offers all services: cards, direct debits (less payroll), immediate transfers, all ATMs...
Without a doubt, 3 banks with offers to take into account for 2021.

It is a direct consequence of their failure to convince people that they should charge for deposits because the ECB charges them. Lie (see here).

Banco Sabadell was a pioneer in imposing more ties or paying commissions (see here). It did it 1 year ago, on December 24, 2019, and what came after in 2020 was more of the same in the rest of the banks.
What Sabadell did was especially burdensome, since to exempt you from paying a commission it required: insurance or a loan or managed funds. It was not enough with the normal links: income, use of cards and receipts.
This policy will be imitated by Banco Santander (it made a few changes before) and will begin to be applied on January 18, 2021 (see here).
In between we have:
We discovered that CaixaBank even charges for sending an email for the client with the result of a transfer (see here)
2020 has been the year of change in ING's strategy and for the worse (for savers, of course).
In April, ING eliminated its Orange deposit, the iconic product that made its clients' money grow (not so much lately) and was no longer the bank for your savings (see here)
In November ING announced that starting in April 2021 it will begin charging €10 in commission per month for the Orange account if you do not meet its conditions (see here). It will therefore cease to be the commission-free bank.
In 2020 we have also lost some banks of great interest:
Without a doubt it has been the Orange Bank Account, which was launched at the end of 2019 and in the month of November it had already attracted more than 60,000 clients and 90 million euros.
It is a high-profit account, all free and with all the services:
The buts, that it has a connection with Orange and requires being an Orange customer to open the account.
First of all, the mobile company is not to everyone's liking. He has done many misdeeds to his clients. If you don't want to know anything about Orange, it is logical that you don't want to know anything about Orange Bank either.
As for the second point, you can register as a prepaid customer (free of charge), and once registered with the bank, throw away the Orange card. It is a mere procedure, but a barrier that more than one does not decide to cross.
The bank has announced that the entity's intention is to open its offer to people who are not Orange customers at the end of 2021.
Not only BBVA that is charging more and more commissions to its clients unless they become more and more connected.
The easy solution is to leave the bank for commission-free alternatives, which there are, but not everyone can because they have certain products contracted from the bank that are not easy to get rid of without cost.
But we tell you how to stay in the bank.
As of April 1, 2021, ING will no longer be the bank without commissions and without conditions.
ING charges a commission for the Orange account if you do not meet certain conditions, something unheard of in the Dutch entity.
With the latest changes made by the big banks: asking for more links or paying more commissions, many people have had no choice but to pay.
The new ties are not acceptable and cannot be left if they have any ties.
We tell you a way to get rid of commissions in these cases."
1024,Wizink with an incident in its Electronic Banking and leaves its clients without access to their money,https://www.tucapital.es/cuentas/wizink-con-una-incidencia-banca-electronica-y-deja-sin-acceso-a-su-dinero-a-sus-clientes/,29/12/2020,"It had been a while, but Wizink's electronic banking has problems again and has been out of service all morning.
It was during a time when not even the public website was accessible. Right now (the time of writing this post, 12:00 on December 29), the problem only affects your electronic banking, returning a 500 or 400 error or indicating that ""There is an error. Some of the information you are providing is not correct. Check it carefully and try again.”
As we say, we had had no major problems for a while, which were very serious when Banco Popular-e clients migrated to Wizink.
Today's incident there are already people reporting the problem. We ourselves have contacted the entity and are waiting for a response.
The bank has not deigned to respond.
As of today, December 30, Wizink electronic banking can be accessed without problems.

The characteristics of its deposits are:
The current features of this account are:
This account can be opened independently or when you take out a deposit.


Wizink's strange move at the beginning of March to extend its deposits for only 4 days, we feared the worst, a new drop, but far from reality the bank increases 2 of its deposits to 3% APR.
Specifically, the bank increases shorter-term deposits, 12 months up to 3% APR and 18 months up to 2.75% APR, a fairly considerable increase: 1 point and 0.65 percentage points respectively.
Wizink deposits were due on February 29, 2024, but the bank has decided to extend it, but only for 4 days, until March 4, 2024. Will there be a new drop?
The current offer, of up to 2.5% APR, was established in October, preceded by another decrease in July.
The current movement of giving only 4 more days to contract these products is something atypical of this bank and we fear the worst, a new cut will come.
The new Wizink Savings Account at 2.3% APR is now available and can be contracted by all savers. It is without demands, without commissions and well paid. It seems very juicy, but is it really worth it? Is this offer competitive?"
